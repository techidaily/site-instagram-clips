Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.

These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-2"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-2" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos.

If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-2"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-2" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos.

The ability to connect, learn, share and sell on Instagram is limitless, but those who achieve the greatest success do so by exploiting every feature the app has to offer. Join the most successful accounts by following these 10 tips for optimizing your Instagram Highlights.</p><h2 id="What-are-Instagram-Highlights"><a href="#What-are-Instagram-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="What are Instagram Highlights?"></a>What are Instagram Highlights?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Highlights <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allow users to take current and past Instagram stories and permanently publish them to your profile. Highlights are featured below a user’s bio and appear in circles, with images and names that coincide with the content of the highlight.</p><p><em>Check this article to learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create an Instagram Story Highlight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></p><h2 id="How-Can-Story-Highlights-Help-Your-Business-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-Can-Story-Highlights-Help-Your-Business-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Can Story Highlights Help Your Business on Instagram?"></a>How Can Story Highlights Help Your Business on Instagram?</h2><p>While the Instagram Story is a fantastic way to share news, information and updates about your business, the information here is only viewable for 24 hours. For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner. The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically" class="headerlink" title="1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically"></a>1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account. Instagram celebrates the visual learners in all of us, use that to your advantage.</p><h3 id="2-Keep-it-Concise"><a href="#2-Keep-it-Concise" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it Concise"></a>2. Keep it Concise</h3><p>This feature allows you to upload up to 100 stories per Highlight. Wow! 100 stories!?</p><p>It seems great, that is until you remember how small of a window you have to capture a potential customer&#x2F;buyer. While some Highlight categories might call for more content, be sure to pick the most important, eye-catching and engaging stories to feature.</p><h3 id="3-Showcasing-Products-Services"><a href="#3-Showcasing-Products-Services" class="headerlink" title="3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services"></a>3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages. Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Company Announcements"></a>4. Make Company Announcements</h3><p>Having a Highlight to feature company&#x2F;business announcements is a great way for your audience to stay up to date with what you have going on.</p><p>Maybe your business is hiring, opening a new storefront, or featuring star employees. This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events"><a href="#5-Promote-Events" class="headerlink" title="5. Promote Events"></a>5. Promote Events</h3><p>Using Instagram to promote your event is a great way to build awareness and gauge interest from your audience.</p><p>Because the story feature only operates for 24 hours, having a Highlight for an upcoming event allows people to view the information for as long as you make it viewable. Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="6. Interact with your Audience"></a>6. Interact with your Audience</h3><p>Gain a better understanding of your customers by interacting with them in your stories. But don’t limit these interactions to 24 hours. By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature. This feature allows you to ask your audience questions and get their feedback in real time. Their responses will be sent directly to your Direct Message box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/interact-with-audience-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight interact with audience"                ></p><h3 id="7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ"><a href="#7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"></a>7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>Instead of leaving things up to the imagination, or having your audience sort through pages to find the answer to their question, creating an FAQ Highlight on your account can help your audience better understand important details about your business.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to include basic information in your FAQ highlight. You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><h3 id="8-How-To-Guides"><a href="#8-How-To-Guides" class="headerlink" title="8. How-To Guides"></a>8. How-To Guides</h3><p>If your product requires assembly or tips for use, consider creating a Highlight that shows customers how to use or build your product. Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials"></a>9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials</h3><p>Nothing helps the buyer’s decision more than seeing other happy customers. There is great value in showing love and support for your product, so don’t hesitate to highlight this in a Highlight. While tip #2 stated the importance of being concise, this is one highlight we recommend you make as long as possible. The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals" class="headerlink" title="10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals"></a>10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals</h3><p>The final tip we’d like to share is using Instagram Highlights to share any promotions or deals you are offering.</p><p>Boosting sales on Instagram is a great way to attract new business and followers. Offering deals to new and existing customers prompts users to interact with your business and generate sales. Running a giveaway on your Instagram can also help build your following. To do so you must include conditions of the giveaway that requires users to follow you and interact with your content in order to be entered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-share-promotion.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - share promotion"                ></p><p>Your business matters to you, and using Instagram Highlights for your business account helps make it matter to your audience. Creating a hub of information that is creatively constructed and strategically categorized is an important resource for driving new and existing customers to buy your products and&#x2F;or visit your website to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-the-realm-of-sponsorships-on-instagram-influencer-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating the Realm of Sponsorships on Instagram  Influencer Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-creating-engaging-video-posts/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Creating Engaging Video Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-incorporating-tunes-into-instagram-reels-for-2024/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide  Incorporating Tunes Into Instagram Reels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-keep-your-digital-treasures-storing-insta-media-on-iphone/"><u>In 2024, Keep Your Digital Treasures  Storing Insta Media on iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-insta-angle-alchemy-crafting-content-with-a-twist-for-maximum-impact/"><u>[Updated] Insta-Angle Alchemy  Crafting Content with a Twist for Maximum Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-igtv-video-downloads-on-windows-and-mac-top-5-methods/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering IGTV Video Downloads on Windows & Mac  Top 5 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-flawless-friending-on-instagram-best-free-safe-mobile-aid-iosandroid/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Flawless Friending on Instagram - Best Free, Safe Mobile Aid (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-tutorial-on-speech-suppression-seamless-vocal-removal-in-adobe-audition-steps-outlined/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Ultimate Tutorial on Speech Suppression Seamless Vocal Removal in Adobe Audition (Steps Outlined)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/top-360-live-streaming-cameras-for-youtube-and-facebook/"><u>Top 360 Live Streaming Cameras for YouTube and Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-prime-video-strategies-selecting-perfect-format-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Prime Video Strategies – Selecting Perfect Format for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-lava-blaze-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Lava Blaze Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-why-integrate-hdr-into-your-film-and-video-workflow/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Why Integrate HDR Into Your Film and Video Workflow</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-13-to-the-previous-ios-system-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone 13 to the Previous iOS System Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-harnessing-hobbies-for-hefty-helpings-on-digital-domains/"><u>In 2024, Harnessing Hobbies for Hefty Helpings on Digital Domains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/taking-your-instagram-game-up-a-notch-advanced-tracking-tools-overview-for-2024/"><u>Taking Your Instagram Game Up a Notch  Advanced Tracking Tools Overview for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-fast-and-free-strategies-for-authenticity-in-insta-circles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Fast & Free Strategies for Authenticity in Insta Circles</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users. It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-skyrocketing-subscribers-5-proven-strategies-for-igtv-success/"><u>[Updated] Skyrocketing Subscribers  5 Proven Strategies for IGTV Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-reach-new-heights-on-igtv-top-tactics-for-expanding-your-audience/"><u>[New] In 2024, Reach New Heights on IGTV  Top Tactics for Expanding Your Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-25-pioneers-reshaping-social-media-landscapes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  25 Pioneers Reshaping Social Media Landscapes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-voice-editing-for-instagrams-media-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Voice Editing for Instagram's Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-secrets-unlocked-advanced-techniques-to-sculpt-your-igtv-content-size-for-2024/"><u>[New] Secrets Unlocked  Advanced Techniques to Sculpt Your IGTV Content Size for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-leveraging-social-media-tactics-more-insta-vids-watched/"><u>[Updated] Leveraging Social Media Tactics  More Insta Vids Watched</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-swiftly-uncover-unfollowers-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Swiftly Uncover Unfollowers on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/integrating-instagram-effects-into-pre-existing-content/"><u>Integrating Instagram Effects Into Pre-Existing Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-instagrams-policies-a-musicians-legal-primer-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling Instagram's Policies  A Musician's Legal Primer for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-infinix-hot-40i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Infinix Hot 40i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/top-10-trending-backgound-music-for-youtube-shorts/"><u>Top 10 Trending Backgound Music for YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/boost-engagement-with-effortless-youtube-thumbnail-tips/"><u>Boost Engagement with Effortless Youtube Thumbnail Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-content-game-mastering-the-art-of-instagram-video-uploads-on-desktop-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Content Game  Mastering the Art of Instagram Video Uploads on Desktop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-going-against-the-flow-youtube-video-opposites/"><u>2024 Approved  Going Against the Flow  YouTube Video Opposites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guide-to-preferred-applications-vtubers-sonic-transformation-journey/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Guide to Preferred Applications  Vtuber's Sonic Transformation Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-facts-you-need-to-know-about-screen-mirroring-vivo-y36i-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Facts You Need to Know about Screen Mirroring Vivo Y36i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/can-you-play-mp4-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mp4-on-android/"><u>Can you play MP4 on Samsung Galaxy A15 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-bypassing-icloud-activation-lock-from-iphone-se-2020-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock from iPhone SE (2020)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-iphone-14-pro-system-issues-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Repair iPhone 14 Pro System Issues?

We’ll look at online solutions, browser add-ons which can work as Instagram image downloader tools and smartphone apps which do the same. Enjoy!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Free online solutions</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Browser add-ons</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: App solutions for your smartphone</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions</h3><h4 id="1-iGram"><a href="#1-iGram" class="headerlink" title="1. ** iGram:"></a>1. ** iGram:</h4><p>This web-based Instagram picture downloader can grab all the images associated with a single post. To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. ** Dredown:"></a>2. ** Dredown:</h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. ** blastup:"></a>3. ** blastup:</h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. ** InstaFinsta:"></a>4. ** InstaFinsta:</h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. ** Inflact:"></a>5. ** Inflact:</h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools.

Downloader for Instagram:"></a>2. <strong>Downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>This Instagram photo downloader for Chrome claims to be the world’s easiest browser extension to download images and videos from Instagram. It supports stories downloads and mass downloads with one click, and also lets you upload photos from your PC too. It’s free, but right now it doesn’t allow video uploads from your PC, although the developers say they are working on that.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Video-Download"><a href="#3-Instagram-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="3. Instagram Video Download:"></a>3. <strong>Instagram Video Download:</strong></h4><p>If you’re more of a Firefox person, Instagram Video Download has got you covered.

Instagram Downloader:"></a>5. <strong>Instagram Downloader:</strong></h4><p>With a hugely loyal following, Opera remains one of the world’s biggest browsers, so we had to include an offering for these guys too. This app to save Instagram videos and images lets you download all images or videos from a particular profile at once, as well as adding a button to individual photos and videos to enable single item downloading too.</p><p>Whichever browser floats your boat, these browser add-ons make Instagram image downloading super simple.

The downloads are fast, and it works on both video and static photos too. There’s no charge to download it but do test it thoroughly as there have been reports of crashes on some devices.</p><h4 id="3-Regrann-–-Repost-for-Instagram"><a href="#3-Regrann-–-Repost-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="3. Regrann – Repost for Instagram:"></a>3. <strong>Regrann – Repost for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>This handy little app works as an Instagram photo downloader and also a reposting tool.

This Instagram picture downloader saves content in HD quality and without watermarks, and all features are free. However, it is rather loaded with ads, so you’ll need patience to get the most from it.</p><p>There are many more options for your app to save Instagram videos, and the right one for you will depend on your preferences, your device and your needs. Most are free to download, so why not try a few out and see which one works best for you?</p><h4 id="Use-Filmora-to-Edit-your-Instagram-Video"><a href="#Use-Filmora-to-Edit-your-Instagram-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora to Edit your Instagram Video"></a>Use Filmora to Edit your Instagram Video</h4><p>Now that you have learned about how to download Instagram, you may want to edit the video and to make it more interesting.
