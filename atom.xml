A watermark can easily ruin that balance without a good reason since it will hardly prevent someone who decided to steal your work from actually doing it.</p><p><strong>Watermarks are easily removed:</strong> Don’t think for a second that anyone with only a basic level of Photoshop skills, can’t crop or clone stamp a watermark from a photo. Unless you intend to place a watermark over an entire image, like stock photography websites do, but even then removing a watermark is far from impossible.</p><p><strong>You won’t look like a pro:</strong> A watermark will not make you look more professional than you already are, the quality of your photos will. Although photographers sign their prints all the time, a watermark can make you look bad in the eyes of the Instagram’s community because you’ll look like you think that your work is so good that everyone is going to try to steal it. Be humble, there are other ways of proving that you own the copyrights to a photo, like keeping the RAW file safely stored on your computer’s hard-drive or including the copyright information in the photo’s metadata.</p><p><strong>Your photos will look like they’ve been edited:</strong> With all the photo effects Instagram offers and all the photo editing options that are available to photographers, straight-out-of-camera pictures will earn you much more respect from the community on Instagram, than photos that are clearly edited. A watermark can often make people think that the picture has been edited since the photographer took the time to design and add a watermark to a photo.</p><p><strong>Adding watermarks will not make you famous:</strong> At first, it may seem like a good idea to use watermarks for the promotion of your business, but most Instagram users don’t really read the names on the watermarks. Strive to produce photos that will make the viewers want to know everything there is to know about you because the quality of your photos is the best advertisement you can get.</p><h2 id="Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips"><a href="#Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips"></a>Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips</h2><p>If, despite all this, you would still like to add a watermark to your Instagram photos, here are a few tips that will help you avoid making mistakes that can be harmful to the success of your images on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Use monochrome watermarks:</strong> Tastefully designed watermarks, that don’t feature too many colors, will serve its purpose, and they will not distract the viewer of a photo too much. A minimalistic approach to watermark design is probably the best, less is more, so use fewer colors in order to achieve better results.</p><p><strong>Place the watermarks around the edges of a photo:</strong> As we already mentioned, adding new visual elements to photos creates all sorts of problems, but if you really want to watermark your photos, at least try to place them on the edges of a photo where they won’t attract too much attention.</p><p><strong>Vertically oriented watermarks create less distraction:</strong> This is a great way to distract the viewer as little as possible while keeping the watermark on your photo clearly visible and readable. If you place a vertically oriented watermark near the edge of a photo, the spectator has a better chance of seeing a photo, before realizing that it has a watermark.</p><p><strong>Carefully choose the font and its size:</strong> Use simple fonts. There is no reason to utilize kitschy fonts that are not easily readable because it isn’t likely that the viewer of a photo is going to spend time on figuring out what the watermark says. Don’t let the watermark become the first thing your Instagram followers see on a photo because they will most probably just keep scrolling without spending a second to figure out what your photo really is about.</p><h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos</h2><h4 id="1-eZy-Watermark-Lite"><a href="#1-eZy-Watermark-Lite" class="headerlink" title="1. eZy Watermark Lite"></a>1. eZy Watermark Lite</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                                     ></p><p>More than 2 million downloads prove that eZy Watermark Lite is one of the best iPhone apps for adding watermarks at the App Store.

Since we got the news, our search mode was on. We went on frenzy to decode what all the new Instagram algorithm is about. Well! After gathering all the information about Instagram’s <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/" >new algorithm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> we are all set to share that with you.</p><p>Whether you are a regular Instagram user, advertiser or an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram influencer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, let’s see how the latest algorithm from Instagram is going to impact you.</p><p>In this article, we are going to introduce what changes the algorithm has brought in. Let’s explore together.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: The 3 mains ranking factors</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: The other important algorithm update</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: Some notes you should know</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-The-3-mains-ranking-factors"><a href="#Part-1-The-3-mains-ranking-factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The 3 mains ranking factors"></a>Part 1: The 3 mains ranking factors</h2><p>Here, we feature the basic factors that contribute to influence your ranking on Instagram.</p><h3 id="Interest-Instagram’s-prediction-about-the-kind-of-posts-you-would-like"><a href="#Interest-Instagram’s-prediction-about-the-kind-of-posts-you-would-like" class="headerlink" title="Interest: Instagram’s prediction about the kind of posts you would like"></a>Interest: Instagram’s prediction about the kind of posts you would like</h3><p>Instagram has announced that the algorithm based timeline would populate your most preferred content on feed. Depending on your interest of content, the photos and videos on your feed would be displayed. A post’s timeliness and your relationship with the person sharing the post also contribute towards it.</p><p>In case you are regularly consuming content from a specific genre, content from that genre might get ranked higher by Instagram on your feed. But, content with less engagement might also be ranked higher on your feed, if that is relevant to your frequently consumed content.</p><p>Advanced photo recognition technologies used with the algorithm enables Instagram to categorize posts into different genres. They might move deeper to fetch more sophisticated genres. Even the #hashtags would prove to be apt tools for the algorithms to look into it.</p><h3 id="Relationship-Most-frequently-interacting-accounts"><a href="#Relationship-Most-frequently-interacting-accounts" class="headerlink" title="Relationship: Most frequently interacting accounts"></a>Relationship: Most frequently interacting accounts</h3><p>When it comes to Instagram algorithm change, it has been noted that Instagram feed ranking algorithm considers you should view the latest post from your favorite person. It makes their posts rank higher on your Instagram feed. It doesn’t matter how many accounts you follow, but with how many of them you interact with.</p><p>According to sources Instagram looks into your past interactions for deciding, your best friends. Factors helpful in tracing the people you care for –</p><ul><li>People known to you in person</li><li>People whom you search</li><li>People whose videos, photos, and stories you like</li><li>People you interact on DM</li></ul><p>According to Instagram’s new algorithm, Instagram possibly thinks your frequent searches for profiles as the ones you care for. It ranks them higher on your feed to avoid searching their profiles repetitively for content. According to an Instagram insider, the new Instagram algorithm has significantly reduced the number of searches.</p><h3 id="Timeliness-Freshness-of-a-post"><a href="#Timeliness-Freshness-of-a-post" class="headerlink" title="Timeliness: Freshness of a post"></a>Timeliness: Freshness of a post</h3><p>Well! Freshness is the key factor in every aspect of life and how Instagram’s new algorithm could escape this. Instagram fills your feed with posts having the freshest and relevant content.</p><p>Older posts might not be of interest to you, when you have latest content which is a day or an hour older. Even if the old posts had lot of engagement, they won’t crawl up your feed. The relevance of your posts is important along with the timeliness to rank higher on Instagram feed.</p><p>Instagram probably re-orders fresh posts between your recent and last visit only. Let’s say you have visited Instagram 2 AM and revisit at 11 AM the same day. If there were 40 posts created when you were away, then the new Instagram algorithm would fetch only those 40 posts. According to this algorithm, the best time for posting content is while your followers are active.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ig-algorithm.JPG"                      alt="ig algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-The-other-important-algorithm-update"><a href="#Part-2-The-other-important-algorithm-update" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The other important algorithm update"></a>Part 2: The other important algorithm update</h2><p>Now that you have been through the most prominent factors of Instagram’s new algorithm and how it drive’s the post ranking on your feeds. Find out, what updates Instagram algorithm has brought.</p><p>Let’s have a look on these secondary but significant factors –</p><h3 id="Frequency"><a href="#Frequency" class="headerlink" title="Frequency"></a>Frequency</h3><p>When you frequently use Instagram every day, you are going to see the latest posts. But, people using it less often end up seeing few days old posts.</p><h3 id="Usage"><a href="#Usage" class="headerlink" title="Usage"></a>Usage</h3><p>The way you access Instagram influences the algorithm to populate your feed. When you browse randomly for few moments, Instagram algorithm will show only the priority posts on your feed.</p><h3 id="Following"><a href="#Following" class="headerlink" title="Following"></a>Following</h3><p>When you follow a limited number of people Instagram algorithm will get few posts to work with. As a result, you would see more posts from everyone. Whereas, following thousands of people will result in seeing lesser posts from each of them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ig-algorithm-timeliness.JPG"                      alt="ig algorithm timeliness"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Some-notes-you-should-know"><a href="#Part-3-Some-notes-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Some notes you should know"></a>Part 3: Some notes you should know</h2><p>Post Instagram algorithm change, you need to keep in mind the following key notes.</p><h3 id="Video-is-better-than-picture"><a href="#Video-is-better-than-picture" class="headerlink" title="Video is better than picture?"></a>Video is better than picture?</h3><p>If you are wondering whether picture or video is better for your Instagram post. Then let’s face it. It’s been the thing of the past and feed ranking universally doesn’t favor whether video or photo formats. It solely depends on what you consume there. If you don’t watch videos then it is less likely to see them on your feed.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Post&#x2F;Share a Video From YouTube on Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Chronological-Instagram-feed-will-come-back"><a href="#Chronological-Instagram-feed-will-come-back" class="headerlink" title="Chronological Instagram feed will come back?"></a>Chronological Instagram feed will come back?</h3><p>Wishing the comeback of chronological Instagram feed won’t be possible. With Instagram’s new algorithm the chance to have a ‘New posts’ button is ruled out. So, in short, you can see everything posted by people you follow by scrolling down your feeds.</p><h3 id="Instagram-algorithm-will-affect-advertisers"><a href="#Instagram-algorithm-will-affect-advertisers" class="headerlink" title="Instagram algorithm will affect advertisers?"></a>Instagram algorithm will affect advertisers?</h3><p>Introduction of Instagram’s new algorithm enhanced the image recognition technology for organizing posts according to video and image content. It has toned down the priority of #hashtags.

Today Instagram stories have become more popular than the OG Snapchat. Instagram stories are a great feature to share your journey with your followers. However, the stories are temporary and only last for 24 hours. You can view the stories of your followers in your feed but you can also check the stories of people you are not following on the discover feed. The person who posted the story can see who has seen the story through Instagram story viewer.</p><p>To find out more about IG story viewer and how it works, continue reading this article.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?"></a>5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories. Other also create fake accounts to conceal their real identity.</p><h2 id="6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="6. How Can I Know If Someone Viewed My Instagram Stories?"></a>6. How Can I Know If Someone Viewed My Instagram Stories?</h2><p>Instagram allows you to see who viewed your story when. To know if someone has viewed your Instagram story simply tap on your profile picture in the story feed and open the story you shared. Now follow these steps:</p><ul><li>At the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see “Seen by [number of views&#x2F;people who have seen the story]”</li><li>Tap on this “Seen by #” option to open your story viewers</li><li>This list contains all the people who have seen your story and tells you how many people have viewed your Instagram story</li></ul><p>A lot of people also use tools to view Instagram stories anonymously so for that you might need an Instagram story viewer app.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change"></a>Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change</h3><p>When it comes to digital platforms algorithms are the tools that determine who should see which content. These algorithms are constantly upgraded to become more relevant and effective over time. This is why digital marketing strategies are also constantly evolving on social media platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-instagram-story-algorithm-change.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-algorithm-change"                ></p><p>When it comes to Instagram, the old # tactics will no longer be effective as Instagram uses advanced algorithms now. Instagram makes sure that all the new content is reaching its intended audience at the right time. However, this change in the algorithm has stirred up the competition. While more and more people try to crack and hack the Instagram algorithm, it best to focus on the quality of content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="Filmora-Best-Instagram-Video-Editor-for-PC"><a href="#Filmora-Best-Instagram-Video-Editor-for-PC" class="headerlink" title="Filmora - Best Instagram Video Editor for PC"></a>Filmora - Best Instagram Video Editor for PC</h3><ul><li>Easily record a Instagram video on PC and Mac.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quickly with a wide range of social effects.</li><li>Rich video tempaltes and resources for Instagram videos.</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p>Instagram prioritizes the best content and the most relevant one. Instead of spamming your followers’ feeds for views, create engaging content to build long-lasting relationship with your followers. Your content should be relevant to your followers and persuade them to comment, like, view, save and share what you post.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5.

Instagram highlights provide a means for users to draw attention to and promote their brand. With these highlights, users can showcase and categorize their best content in a fancy and eye-catching way! Amazing right? Yes, it is and this is because Instagram highlights are front and center on your profile! This is a guide to Instagram highlights which explains what they are and how to use them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?</h2><p>Instagram highlights, also known as Instagram story highlights, were introduced on the 5th December of 2017. An Instagram Highlight is displayed as a neat little circle on your profile. Unlike Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Instagram highlights stay on your profile permanently, until you choose to delete them. These highlights are tools designed by Instagram to enable its users to hold on to their favorite moments from their Instagram stories and share them in any way that allows them to express themselves.</p><p>Instagram highlights were included as a new feature of Instagram profiles through which users can express more about who they are through the various stories they have shared. They are designed to appear in the section on your profile which is located below your bio.</p><p>Story Highlights allows you to display all sides of your personality, and you can create highlights from anything you’ve already posted to your Story. From moments from your birthday dinner to moments of your vacation with friends. All these cherished memories, when shared on your Stories, can be saved and featured as Highlights on your Instagram profile.</p><p>An amazing feature of Instagram highlights is that you can group your stories into sections and create them as folder sections (i.e highlights) on your profile. Once you post a story, you can save it in a Highlight (which is like a folder) and that will automatically be featured on your profile permanently until you decide to delete it or archive it. With this tool, you can design your profile in a unique way that best expresses you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Highlights are created through your Stories.

Instagram highlights provide a means for users to draw attention to and promote their brand. With these highlights, users can showcase and categorize their best content in a fancy and eye-catching way! Amazing right? Yes, it is and this is because Instagram highlights are front and center on your profile! This is a guide to Instagram highlights which explains what they are and how to use them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?</h2><p>Instagram highlights, also known as Instagram story highlights, were introduced on the 5th December of 2017. An Instagram Highlight is displayed as a neat little circle on your profile. Unlike Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Instagram highlights stay on your profile permanently, until you choose to delete them. These highlights are tools designed by Instagram to enable its users to hold on to their favorite moments from their Instagram stories and share them in any way that allows them to express themselves.</p><p>Instagram highlights were included as a new feature of Instagram profiles through which users can express more about who they are through the various stories they have shared. They are designed to appear in the section on your profile which is located below your bio.</p><p>Story Highlights allows you to display all sides of your personality, and you can create highlights from anything you’ve already posted to your Story. From moments from your birthday dinner to moments of your vacation with friends. All these cherished memories, when shared on your Stories, can be saved and featured as Highlights on your Instagram profile.</p><p>An amazing feature of Instagram highlights is that you can group your stories into sections and create them as folder sections (i.e highlights) on your profile. Once you post a story, you can save it in a Highlight (which is like a folder) and that will automatically be featured on your profile permanently until you decide to delete it or archive it. With this tool, you can design your profile in a unique way that best expresses you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Highlights are created through your Stories. You have two options for creating a Highlight. The first is that you either create a Highlight from a current Story or your Stories Archive.</p><p>Your Stories Archive is a feature that when enabled, ensures your Stories are automatically saved in your archive. Only you will be able to see them when the Stories have disappeared after 24 hours.

Until recently Instagram was a platform that was mainly dedicated to photos because the duration of the videos you could upload to your account was limited to just sixty seconds. All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload videos that last up to one hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV"><a href="#How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="How to Get More Followers on IGTV?"></a>How to Get More Followers on IGTV?</h2><p> Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers"></a>1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don’t allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.</p><h3 id="Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Ready to try Instagram Reels?"></a>Ready to try Instagram Reels?</h3><p>Instagram reels have brought users a great opportunity of creating short yet influential videos right in the app. The ease and convenience of creating and editing videos is the reason behind its success</p><p>And, now you know all there is to know about Instagram reels.

However, the videos you share on your IGTV channel can benefit quite a bit from simple things like a<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video title, a description of a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or a cover photo. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of creating and changing an IGTV cover photo.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Dimensions and Specifications for Cover Photos on IGTV</li><li>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</li><li>Part 3: Bonus!

Hence the cover photos you can add to your IGTV videos have to be <strong>vertically oriented</strong> as well, and if you would like to prevent IGTV from cropping your cover photo, you need to make sure that the picture matches the platform’s specifications. If you follow these specifications the cover photos for your IGTV videos are going to look equally good inside the IGTV app, the Instagram.com website, Instagram app search grid or Instagram app search feed.</p><p>YouTuber The K Guy has made a video to demonstrate the IGTV Cover Thumbnail size and dimensions and safe zone. You can check the video tutorial below.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to make thumbnails with an online thumbnail maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The images you use as cover photos for your videos will be displayed in different aspect ratios depending on the device that is used to view them. You can use a picture that has <strong>1080X1680</strong> pixels, <strong>a near 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>, as a cover photo for all IGTV videos you upload to your channel or you can choose to work with smaller images that <strong>have 420X654 pixels and a 1:1.55 aspect ratio.</strong> If you upload a cover photo that has <strong>1080X1920 pixels</strong> the platform will automatically <strong>crop approximately 120 pixels</strong> from both shorter and longer sides of the image. The size of a file you’re using for an IGTV video cover photo cannot exceed <strong>4MB,</strong> and the file must be saved as <strong>a JPEG</strong> since presently this is the only picture file format supported by IGTV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/igtv-cover-photo-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="IGTV Cover Photo Safe Zone"                ></p><p>While creating a cover photo for an IGTV video you need to keep in mind that different graphics and text overlays are going to be displayed over the picture once you upload it to your channel. During the process of uploading IGTV video’s cover photo, you will be able to add text to it, but the <strong>Title Safe Area</strong> suggests where you can place the text without the risk of it being cropped while being viewed from different devices won’t be shown. So, make sure that all text you add to your IGTV video cover photo is <strong>placed in the central area of the image</strong> in order for it to be clearly visible on all devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Cover-Photo-for-Your-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?"></a>Part 2: How to Create a Cover Photo for Your IGTV Channel?</h2><p>Adding a cover photo to your IGTV video is easy since you just have <strong>to upload a photo from your camera roll or from a video.</strong> After adding a title of a video and a description you can simply tap on <strong>the Edit Cover option</strong> and select either <strong>Upload from Camera Roll or Choose Cover from Video</strong> options and proceed to pick the image you want to upload. In case you choose to add a picture from a video you will be able to navigate to the exact point in the video where the still frame you’d like to use a cover photo is located. The picture will be automatically added as your cover photo as soon as you confirm the changes.</p><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Photo editing apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for iPhones and Android</strong> devices can help you create captivating cover photos for your IGTV videos, but you can also edit your IGTV cover photos with the image editor that is available in Instagram Stories. Despite the limited amount of features you will have at your disposal, using Instagram Stories to create cover photos for your IGTV videos is still a good idea, especially if you’re looking for a way to quickly save an image to your camera roll and upload it as an IGTV cover photo.</p><p>Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to edit IGTV videos with best app on mobile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Bonus!

Well, we understand your situation. Obviously, if you have to upload your photos or videos one at a time, it may feel quite boring and frustrating, especially when you have dozens of them lined up in the queue. But here’s the good news!</p><h2 id="Introducing-Carousel"><a href="#Introducing-Carousel" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Carousel"></a>Introducing Carousel</h2><p> Instagram’s update 10.9 for Android and iOS allows its users to upload upto 10 photos and videos in one go. This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone. Tap and hold, on any of the preferred image or video which you wish to upload, until you sense a slight vibration. Now, you have enabled the ‘Select Multiple’, scroll through the gallery and select rest 9 photos or videos that you wish to upload.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-2.png"                                     ></p><p> Alternatively, if you have upgraded your Instagram app, you can simply tap the ‘Select Multiple’ option, represented by an icon of ‘stacked squares’, and select up to 10 photos&#x2F;videos.</p><p> Note: Make sure to select the images, in the sequence you want them to occur in your post. A number appears on the top right corner of every image which shows you the sequence in which they will be uploaded. Tap ‘Next’ when you are done selecting the images&#x2F;videos.</p><ul><li>(Optional) The next screen allows you to apply filters and edit your images. The filter you choose will be auto applied to all the images.</li></ul><p> If in case, you want a different filter for each or any specific image, tap on that particular image and apply the filter of your choice. Once you are satisfied with your selection, tap ‘Done’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-3.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>(Optional) If you’ve selected less than 10 photos and want to add more, tap ‘&lt;’ or go back to the previous screen or tap ‘+’ displayed on the right side of the photos&#x2F;videos.
