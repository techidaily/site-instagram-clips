While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1. Grum"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.grum.co/" >Grum <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Planning and scheduling your posts in advance is a great way to carry out your social media advertising campaign. Grum is the perfect tool that will enable social media managers to save time on posting content to Instagram accounts they are managing because they can schedule weekly posts.</p><p>The platform lets you upload videos and photos to your Grum account, and you can easily schedule your next post by clicking on the Schedule icon. A three-day trial is available if you want to test Grum before deciding which pricing plan best fits your needs.</p><h4 id="2-Planoly"><a href="#2-Planoly" class="headerlink" title="2. Planoly"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.planoly.com/" >Planoly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you take your social media posts seriously, then a tool as powerful as Planoly will certainly help you with developing your Instagram accounts. The platform offers several different pricing options that start from $7 a month for a single account, while teams that need to manage as many as ten accounts can easily do so for $199 per month.</p><p>Uploading and scheduling content is fast and easy, which means that you can schedule posts months in advance. Planoly’s ‘Analyze’ option will also help you to get a better picture of your audience since it can help you increase user engagement and sales of your products.</p><h4 id="3-Buffergram"><a href="#3-Buffergram" class="headerlink" title="3. Buffergram"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://buffergram.com/" >Buffergram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Unlike many other companies that just provide scheduling services, Buffergram actually posts your content to Instagram. This platform is aimed at high-end professionals who can’t afford a second-rate service, which is why it also tells you how well your posts are performing on Instagram. Furthermore, their Agency package allows you to handle several Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><p>People who choose to utilize Buffergram’s services can choose who many posts per day they want, so a post a day will cost you just $5 dollars a month while 5 daily posts cost $20 per month. Packages that include tracking services are also available.</p><h4 id="4-Onlypult"><a href="#4-Onlypult" class="headerlink" title="4. Onlypult"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://onlypult.com/" >Onlypult <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is an easy to use and cost-effective tool that automatically posts scheduled photos and videos to your Instagram account. What’s more Onlypult stores your hashtags, which means that you can easily add hashtags you already used to new posts. During the scheduling process, you can upload as many photos and videos as you want and you can also apply filters, select the aspect ratio or add captions.</p><p>For $55 a month you can manage 40 Instagram accounts and post an unlimited number of posts to each of these accounts, which is the reason why Onlypult is the perfect tool for your Instagram marketing campaign.</p><h4 id="5-Gramblr"><a href="#5-Gramblr" class="headerlink" title="5. Gramblr"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://gramblr.en.softonic.com/" >Gramblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This desktop app enables you to post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop. Gramblr doesn’t offer scheduling services, but it is so easy to use that most digital marketers will have to think twice before choosing to use some other option for uploading content to Instagram. Gramblr is available for both Mac and Windows OS and it offers more than 50 filters. In addition, you can add captions in any language, while you can also keep track of the basic analytics.</p><p>You can download Gramblr for free, but despite its advantages, this app lacks more advanced option that makes posting to Instagram much easier.</p><h4 id="6-Later"><a href="#6-Later" class="headerlink" title="6. Later"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/" >Later <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The fact that some of the most famous brands in the world use the services Latter provides shows that this one of the best platforms for scheduling and posting videos on Instagram. Furthermore, individuals can use Latter for free as long as they want, while agencies and large marketing teams can manage up to five accounts per platform for only $49 per month.</p><p>Latter gives you access to advanced analytics that can be essential to your online marketing strategy and it allows you to upload content from your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p><h4 id="7-Schedugr"><a href="#7-Schedugr" class="headerlink" title="7. Schedugr"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://schedugr.am/" >Schedugr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is probably one of the most convenient tools for uploading photos and videos to Instagram because all uploads are automatic. You can crop, add filters and text or rotate images, while you can also post immediately or schedule a post. ScheduGram’s users can manage several accounts at the same time and save a significant amount of time by scheduling posts months in advance.</p><p>The pricing plans are based on the number of accounts you are managing with this tool, which means that you’ll have to pay $20 per month to manage a single account with ScheduGram. Even though ScheduGram is a powerful tool, its services may be a bit pricey.</p><h4 id="8-Dropbox"><a href="#8-Dropbox" class="headerlink" title="8. Dropbox"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.dropbox.com/install" >Dropbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Dropbox isn’t a tool that will enable you to upload photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop, but if you have Dropbox installed on your computer and Smartphone you can use it to easily post content on Instagram. After you downloaded and installed Dropbox on your computer and your Smartphone, upload the video you want to share to the desktop version of Dropbox and then find the video you uploaded from the app installed on your Smartphone.</p><p>Click on the Export option and Instagram will appear as one of the provided options, then just take the steps you would normally take if you were posting a video on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevate-to-a-custom-hashtag-mastery-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevate to a Custom Hashtag Mastery on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-sponsorships-partnering-effectively-with-brands-live/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Sponsorships Partnering Effectively with Brands Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transform-your-speech-access-to-no-cost-voice-manipulation-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Transform Your Speech Access to No-Cost Voice Manipulation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/customize-your-scroll-delete-instagram-suggestions/"><u>Customize Your Scroll Delete Instagram Suggestions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/daily-revenue-of-podcasters-worldwide/"><u>Daily Revenue of Podcasters Worldwide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/decode-insta-success-your-comprehensive-guide-to-understanding-user-insights/"><u>Decode Insta Success Your Comprehensive Guide to Understanding User Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/enhance-your-presence-how-to-change-voice-effectively-on-ig/"><u>Enhance Your Presence How to Change Voice Effectively on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/everlasting-impressions-save-instagram-stories-endlessly/"><u>Everlasting Impressions Save Instagram Stories Endlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-poco-m6-pro-4g-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Poco M6 Pro 4G to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-xiaomi-13-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Xiaomi 13 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/instagram-tv-disable-guide/"><u>Instagram TV Disable Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/instagram-victory-tackling-video-tribulations-head-on/"><u>Instagram Victory Tackling Video Tribulations Head-On</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/resolving-audio-problems-a-guide-to-fixing-malfunctioning-speakers-in-laptops/"><u>Resolving Audio Problems: A Guide to Fixing Malfunctioning Speakers in Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-honor-magic-vs-2-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Honor Magic Vs 2 Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7.

Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9.

This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?

As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can’t really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.</p><p>Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.</p><p>In order to start recording an Instagram story, you’ll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app’s screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes.

You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016143/19272" target="_top" id="2016143">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016143" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016143/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos.

In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed.

Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view. The number of views a video gets indicates the total number of people who interacted with it, even for a period of time that is as brief as a couple of seconds.</p><p><strong>Engagements –</strong> This metric shows you the combined number of likes and comments a video has at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention –</strong> A rather important statistic that tells you the percentage of all viewers who watched a video from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention Graph –</strong> A visual representation of the percentage of all views a video has at any moment. You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137224/26400" target="_top" id="2137224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137224/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148640/16836" target="_top" id="2148640">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148640" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="234" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148640/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media. Do you think that audience retention or engagement rates can be essential for developing a viable online marketing strategy?

To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. Inflact:"></a>5. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/" >Inflact: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082536/7443" target="_top" id="2082536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082536/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools.

In fact, once you know what you’re doing, you’ll be able to crank every single visual you post into top gear, with just a few taps here and there. Here are some top tips on how to edit Instagram photos to help you post like a true pro.</p><ul><li><strong>Take a great photo to begin with</strong></li></ul><p> It’s a bit of a no-brainer, but if your photograph sucks from the get-go, none of the Instagram photo editor apps will fix your mess for you. Take heed of our photography tips and begin with an awesome shot before you’ve even started to fiddle with the software.</p><ul><li><strong>Upload like a pro</strong></li></ul><p> Hopefully you’re comfortable with uploading images to Instagram, but if you’re still in the dark, here’s how to do it. Open the Instagram app on your device and click the plus sign to upload an image. You’ll find this in the bottom of your screen front and centre. From here, simply click the photo you’d like to upload from your camera roll.</p><p> When you upload, Instagram automatically crops your image to their signature square format. However, if you haven’t decided how you want to crop your photo or would prefer it at its original width, you can simply click the expand icon in the left corner to take it back to full size. You can upload one image, or up to 10 photos at once, so don’t be shy!</p><ul><li><strong>Select your filter</strong></li></ul><p> Now you can start to really have some fun! The built in Instagram photo editor app is a pretty powerful little tool, and there’s loads of tweaks and edits you can make to step your photo sharing up a notch. The first thing to do is choose one of the many awesome filters which are built into the Instagram app.</p><p> There’s no hard and fast rule about which filter looks best; it really comes down to personal taste. However, it’s worth thinking about what you want to achieve, and go for a filter that creates the right type of atmosphere for your scene. Here are some of the most popular Instagram filters, and how each one will change your image:</p><ul><li><strong>X Pro II:</strong> One of our favorites, this one sharpens, adds contrast and a vignette edge, to give photos a dramatic, professional effect. This one is a particularly good choice for modern photos of people</li><li><strong>Moon:</strong> If you love black and white photography, this filter is a great choice. Shadows are more intense, highlights seem to pop and the soft focusing gives a nicely aged look to the images.</li><li><strong>Lo-Fi:</strong> Another favorite over here, Lo-Fi saturates your image with rich colors and darkens all the shadows to add drama and intrigue.</li><li><strong>Hefe:</strong> If you love the vintage look, Hefe will be a great choice. It adds a yellow tone and darker border for an edgy, aged appearance to your shots.</li><li><strong>Valencia:</strong> Hefe not aged enough for you? Try out Valencia. The addition of warm tones and faded colors will give your images an antique look, perfect for Insta-greatness.</li></ul><p> There are plenty of other filters to play with, so have a tinker and see which ones you like best. You may find that different filters suit different types of shots, or that you prefer to use the same one or two to give your Instagram feed a uniform style that is all your own.</p><p> To help you refine your photos with the same filters regularly, you can reorder the filter options on the Instagram photo editor app itself. Simply press and hold the three grey lines on the filter you want to move, then slide it into the position you wish. You can also hide filters entirely from the ‘manage’ functions of the menu, so that you don’t keep being offered a filter you really don’t like.</p><ul><li><strong>Add a touch of lux</strong></li></ul><p> Have you ever noticed the lux function on Instagram? If you want to know how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, then this is one feature you really need to get to know intimately. It’s super easy to use, but perhaps you’ve never found it. Well, let us welcome you to the world of better photos.</p><p> When you’re still on the filter selection screen, do you see that little sunshine-like symbol at the top? Hit that, and then fiddle with the slider to add more of less lux to your image. This tool automatically tweaks the saturation and contrast, adding vibrancy to your photos and highlighting the small details that make a good photo great. Slide up for more or down for less and learn to love the lux touch!</p><ul><li><strong>Do some basic editing</strong></li></ul><p> Within the Instagram photo editor app, aside of the filters there are also some tools for the most basic of manual image editing. It’s well worth becoming adept at these, because on your quest to discover how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, these handy functions really do separate the men from the boys. Here’s how they work:</p><ul><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Also know as the ‘straighten my shot’ tool this is crucial if, like so many of us, you’re incapable of taking a photo completely straight. Find something perfectly horizontal or vertical, and line it up with the handy guides within the tool.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Shots a bit shady? This can add a touch of sunlight and brightness to any image, very useful for those taken in poor lighting or at night.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> When everything is somewhat wishy-washy, contrast will adjust the difference in light balance to add more variation between light and shadow. Alternatively, if your image is a bit over exposed, less contrast can tone things down a bit.</li><li><strong>Structure:</strong> When you want to pick out those little details, structure will help add texture to your image. Great for landscapes and nature photos but not so great on portraits.</li><li><strong>Warmth:</strong> Adjusting the tones on your images can make things more dramatic, friendlier, or more edgy. Sliding the tool to the right will add sepia and orange tones, perfect for a sunset or holiday shot, whereas to the left will make things cooler and more blue-ish.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Adjusting the saturation can make the colors in your photos more vibrant but be cautious in its use as it can make photos look totally over-edited. Slide the adjuster completely to the left to turn your image black and white.</li><li><strong>Fade:</strong> As you might guess, fade makes your picture look faded. It’s great for manually adding a vintage feel to your photos if the built-in filters just aren’t doing it for you.</li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Make whites whiter and brights brighter by adjusting this setting up or move it down to tone down highlights that are just too poppy.</li><li><strong>Shadow:</strong> As the alter-ego to highlights, you can already guess what this tool does. Use it to add drama by darkening shadows in your image, or make previously unseen details reappear by reducing the depth of the dark areas.</li><li><strong>Color:</strong> Add a tint to your photos of your choice of color and choose whether to apply it to the shadows or highlights of the image.</li><li><strong>Vignette:</strong> Love the attention focusing abilities of dark edges around your subject? Vignette adds this automatically, and you can adjust the intensity of this effect with ease.</li><li><strong>Tilt shift:</strong> If you want something in the foreground in focus and everything else out of focus, this is the tool that imitates what only the most expensive cameras can do. Choose a circular shift to pick out a particular object, or a linear shift to focus everything at a certain depth in the photo.</li><li><strong>Sharpen:</strong> To make your images super clear, sharpen is a great tool. Unlike Structure it doesn’t add extra detail, it simply enhances the details that were already there for a clearer, more professional image.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve finished editing your image, you’re all ready to post it. Don’t forget to make the most of hashtags and an interesting caption to help other users find your photos and consider tagging your location to get even more likes and followers.</p><p> So now you know how to edit Instagram photos on the Instagram photo editor app. You don’t always have to post your photos to Instagram either. Simply turn on your airplane mode and the app will allow you to save your photos locally, letting you make use of all the funky tools available without having to share your images directly.</p><p> Do remember that Instagram images are 1080 x 1080 pixels when they are uploaded. You might not realise this as they are certainly a lot smaller when you view them. Instagram itself resizes each image to 612 x 612 pixels, but when it’s displayed in a user’s feed, it’s even smaller again, at just 510 x 510.</p><p> What this means for you is that, although the picture displayed is small, any distortion caused by expansion of a small image in the first place will be replicated even at smaller sizes. When it comes to insta-worthy images, quality is king, so never be tempted to share anything that is any less than 1080 x 1080 pixels. If you’ve got smaller pictures that you are itching to share, do so via other social media platforms.</p><p> How is your Instagram photo editing going?

Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded. Now at the bottom left corner, you will number of people who have viewed your story, tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step2.jpg"                      alt="methods to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now you can see the number of people who viewed your story and all those people who have viewed your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step3.jpg"                      alt="check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p>This is the easiest way of how to see who viewed your Instagram post. But if you are thinking about the images and videos that you post your feed or timeline, then you can see the number of people who viewed your post all those who liked it by following these few simple steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129740/7443" target="_top" id="2129740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to any post that you want to track and see how many people have viewed and who liked it. Below your video or image, you can see ‘Liked by’. Click on the ‘others’ next to the name of the person who liked your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png"                      alt="use likes to check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.</p><p>Since this method doesn’t show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn’t provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

In this part, I will show you how to upload the looping live photos to Instagram.</p><p> <strong>Step 1: Add Bounce or Loop Effect to Live Photos</strong></p><p>Go to Photos app on iPhone and open the live photo. Swipe up and you will four options: live, loop, and bounce, and long exposure. To make a live looping photo, click on the loop option, which can turn the live photo to a video loop directly; or you can choose Bounce effect, which will make the live photo rock back and forth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-loop-bounce-effect-to-live-photos.jpg"                      alt="convert live photo to looping video on iPhone"                ></p><p> <strong>Step 2: Save Looping Live Photo into A Video</strong></p><p>If you sharing the live photo applied Loop or Bounce effect to social media directly, you will find the animation is lost. So, before sharing, we need to save the looping live photo to video first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-looping-live-photo-to-video.jpg"                      alt="Convert live photo to looping video on iPhone"                ></p><p>Click the Share button under the left corner, and then click Save to Files, specify the destination folder and click Save. The loop live photo will be save in MOV format.</p><p> <strong>Step 3: Share the video on Instagram</strong></p><p>To upload the video to Instagram, go the Instagram, and then click on the plus icon in the middle of the bottom bar.
