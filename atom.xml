The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:</p><ul><li><strong>Going Live</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Active</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there’s a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with audience</strong></li></ul><p>Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers.

It is this appeal that brings the design of their profile to life. Also, it makes the visitors feel the user-friendliness of the profile. There’s a reason why Starbucks is loved by everyone, isn’t it?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ig-highlight-cover-photo-starbucks.jpg"                      alt="ig highlight cover photo starbucks"                ></p><h4 id="4-The-Kitchn"><a href="#4-The-Kitchn" class="headerlink" title="4.The Kitchn"></a>4.The Kitchn</h4><p>The Kitchn’s all-things-food account has cooking how-tos and recipes, along with tips for organizing and cleaning the kitchen. Their IG highlights add to their regular posts and even showcase some of their behind-the-scenes action. Also, they have a Story Highlight termed Kitchn Pets where they post the images of adorable furry friends in the kitchen, from both their audience as well as staff members.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-kitchn.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover kitchn"                ></p><h4 id="5-Glossier-Inc"><a href="#5-Glossier-Inc" class="headerlink" title="5.Glossier Inc"></a>5.Glossier Inc</h4><p>Glossier Inc. is a people-powered beauty ecosystem. The brand uses pink color only for their profile image (not a logo). For the Highlights Covers, they use only white images. This makes their Highlights very minimalistic and very different than other accounts where product images or icons are generally used.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-glossier.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover glossier"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fashion-Nova"><a href="#6-Fashion-Nova" class="headerlink" title="6.Fashion Nova"></a>6.Fashion Nova</h4><p>Fashion Nova, an international fashion brand, relies heavily on its ability to ship worldwide quickly. So, it’s not surprising that one of their Highlights is dedicated just to shipping. It seems as if some of their customers had certain shipping issues in the past. So, their Highlight uses rave reviews for showing that the issues have been solved, while simultaneously communicating to the new customers that they have lightning-fast shipping.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-fashion.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover fashion"                ></p><h4 id="7-Red-Bull"><a href="#7-Red-Bull" class="headerlink" title="7.Red Bull"></a>7.Red Bull</h4><p>Earlier, Red Bull’s IG Highlights used to be fairly conservative like projects, videos, events, etc. But, this has changed. Now their athletes have their own dedicated highlight. All one gets is a name, face, and emoji. Very intriguing, isn’t it? This is a great inspiration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-redbull.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover redbull"                ></p><h4 id="8-Tide"><a href="#8-Tide" class="headerlink" title="8.Tide"></a>8.Tide</h4><p>In their Instagram Highlights, Tide Bank uses colors that are consistent with their brand. This makes for the spotlight areas of the business that the customers are drawn to. What makes Tide Bank’s Story Highlights a fantastic example for businesses is that the Highlight titles also include emojis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-tide.png"                      alt="insta highlight cover tide"                ></p><h4 id="9-Perfect-Bar"><a href="#9-Perfect-Bar" class="headerlink" title="9.Perfect Bar"></a>9.Perfect Bar</h4><p>Perfect Bar – the makers of non-GMO and organic protein bars – is another brand you can take inspiration from for creating great Insta highlight cover images. Their account has an Insta Highlight called ‘In a Nutshell’ where they answer the commonly asked questions of their customers. Every In a Nutshell session has a theme and even the older FAQ sessions are included in their Highlights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-perfect-bar.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover perfect bar"                ></p><h4 id="10-Anthropologie"><a href="#10-Anthropologie" class="headerlink" title="10.Anthropologie"></a>10.Anthropologie</h4><p>Anthropologie is one brand that does many things right. So, it’s no surprise that they have nailed their IG Story Highlights, too. What sets them apart from most other businesses are their branded Highlights, such as #AnthroHome and MyAnthro.</p><p>With the #AnthroHome Highlight, they do a few things differently. Occasionally, they have styled spaces and visitors can swipe up to directly shop the look. For their #MyAnthro Highlight, they feature fans of Anthropologie and tag their account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/insta-highlight-cover-anthropologie.jpg"                      alt="insta highlight cover anthropologie"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Insta-Highlight-Cover" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Insta Highlight Cover?</h2><p>Want to create Instagram Story Highlights under your bio on your own?

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134499/19576" target="_top" id="2134499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134499/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List-3"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order-3"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers-3"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story-3"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories.

There’s no need to worry about photo sizes or aspect ratios because Instagram is going to the all the heavy work for you.</p><p>Troubles begin when you want to upload photos and videos that weren’t captured with a Smartphone to Instagram. In most cases, the photos and videos produced by DSLR cameras and other semi-professional and professional equipment are much larger than the sizes supported by Instagram. That is the reason why we created this guide that will help you post visual content that is perfectly adjusted to Instagram in 2021.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram"><a href="#Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Types of Files Accepted by Instagram"></a>Types of Files Accepted by Instagram</h2><p>The first thing you need to pay attention to when uploading images and videos to Instagram is that the files you are uploading are in one of the photo or video formats that Instagram supports.</p><p><strong>Photo File Types</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Instagram supports only two file formats. You should make sure that your photo is either saved in <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> file format because all other file formats won’t do the trick, and you’ll be forced to go back to the photo editor you used and change the file format before you can upload a photo to Instagram. Posting GIF files is not possible without apps such as GIPHY CAM or GifLab because this type of files isn’t supported by Instagram.</p><p><strong>Video File Types</strong></p><p>Things get much easier when it comes to video since Instagram supports nearly all video file formats you can think of. However, the most commonly used types of video files uploaded to Instagram are have an  codec and a MP.4 file extension, which is the reason why we recommend converting your video files into this file format before uploading them to Instagram.</p><p>Duration of Videos on Instagram</p><p>You can either upload a video to Instagram’s main feed or you can upload it as a story. If you decide to upload a video to the main feed, the time limit is set at just 60 seconds, while the length of a video in an Instagram story cannot exceed 15 seconds.</p><h2 id="Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts"><a href="#Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts"></a>Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts</h2><p>A couple of years ago, Instagram has finally allowed its users to upload images that aren’t square shaped. In 2021, you can also upload horizontally and vertically oriented photos in addition to the standard square shape. However, in order to create a perfect Instagram post, and prevent the platform from cropping your photos you need to use the Instagram image sizes featured below.</p><h4 id="Instagram’s-Main-Feed"><a href="#Instagram’s-Main-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Instagram’s Main Feed"></a>Instagram’s Main Feed</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-sizes-infographic-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>The main feed on Instagram is the place where all the posts from people you are following on this platform are displayed. So let’s take a look at the perfect Instagram photo sizes for the main feed.</p><ul><li><strong>Square</strong></li></ul><p>Most digital cameras don’t produce this shape of a photo, which means that you’ll have to change width and height values before you upload a photo to Instagram. The best Instagram photo size for square-shaped images is 1080 px X 1080 px in 1:1 aspect ratio because if you use a picture that has fewer or more pixels than that, the platform may resize your photo automatically.</p><ul><li><strong>Landscape</strong></li></ul><p>This type of picture orientation is frequently used for both videos and photos, however, if you want to upload a horizontally oriented photo to Instagram, we recommend that you use 1,91:1 aspect ratio and 1080 px X 566 px values for the size of a photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Portrait</strong></li></ul><p>Portrait or vertically oriented photos on Instagram should have 8:10 aspect ratio and a 1080 px size value for the shorter side of a photo, and 1350 px value for the longer side of a photo you’d like to post to Instagram.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Stories"><a href="#Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Stories"></a>Instagram Stories</h4><p>The photos you post as stories on Instagram are always vertically oriented and for that reason, you should change their aspect ratio to 9:16 and set their size to 1080X1920px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Profile-Pictures"><a href="#Instagram-Profile-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Profile Pictures"></a>Instagram Profile Pictures</h4><p>The profile pictures on Instagram are tiny, and the optimum size for them is 160X160 px, while their shape is always a square which means that you’ll have to set their aspect ratio to 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Taking photos with iPhones and Android Smartphones and posting them to Instagram is easy because you only have to snap a photo, launch the Instagram app, and apply filters that this amazing platform offers.

Until recently Instagram was a platform that was mainly dedicated to photos because the duration of the videos you could upload to your account was limited to just sixty seconds. All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >upload videos that last up to one hour <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV"><a href="#How-to-Get-More-Followers-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="How to Get More Followers on IGTV?"></a>How to Get More Followers on IGTV?</h2><p> Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers"></a>1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page.

This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice.

Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.</p><ul><li><em>Asking about a location</em></li></ul><p>You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.</p><ul><li><em>Instagram Poll Questions on Food</em></li></ul><p>Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.</p><ul><li><em>This or That</em></li></ul><p>You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.</p><ul><li><em>Can you relate?</em></li></ul><p>These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.</p><ul><li><em>Love or Hate</em></li></ul><p>This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.</p><ul><li><em>Rating on a Scale</em></li></ul><p>Apart from a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question. Your audience can just slide the scale (from zero to max) and let you know how much they like&#x2F;dislike anything.</p><ul><li><em>Do you agree?</em></li></ul><p>You can also see a lot of poll questions for Instagram in this pattern. Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it. You can also ask them to DM you about their opinion if you want to engage with them.</p><h2 id="Explore-More-Ways-to-Use-Instagram-Polls"><a href="#Explore-More-Ways-to-Use-Instagram-Polls" class="headerlink" title="Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls"></a>Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls</h2><p>When it comes to the use of Instagram Polls, the sky is the limit.

Get Instant Feedback"></a>1. Get Instant Feedback</h4><p>If you know how to do a poll on Instagram efficiently, then you can instantly get the feedback of your audience. For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram. In this way, you can know the feedback of its end-users and would help in the product’s development as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-instant-ig-poll-feedback.jpg"                      alt="Instant Instagram Poll Feedback"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2128842/7443" target="_top" id="2128842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2128842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2128842/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Be-Creative"><a href="#2-Be-Creative" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Creative"></a>2. Be Creative</h4><p>You might already know there are so many ways to do Instagram polls these days. Though, if you want your content to stand out, then try to be a bit creative. Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!
