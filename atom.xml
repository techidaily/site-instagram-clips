Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.

The Stories feature of Instagram might be added a few years back, but it is already accessed by over 500 million active users. If you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >explore the Instagram Stories feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then you will realize it offers different ways to interact with our audience, like polls and questions. In this post, I’m going to let you know <strong>how to do a poll on Instagram</strong> and will also share some interesting ideas to post poll questions for Instagram. Let’s get it started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-poll.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Poll"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is an Instagram Poll?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Why are Instagram Polls Important?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create an Instagram Story Poll</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-an-Instagram-Poll"><a href="#What-is-an-Instagram-Poll" class="headerlink" title="What is an Instagram Poll?"></a>What is an Instagram Poll?</h2><p>It is a newly-added feature in Instagram Stories that lets us host a poll on our profile (for at most 24 hours). All you need to do is add the Poll feature and enter the provided options. As of now, it only supports two options (like yes or no). Once the poll is posted on your story, your audience can select either of the options. You will get to know the results (who voted for which option) and can even share it with your audience as a story later on.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Instagram-Polls-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Instagram-Polls-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Instagram Polls Important?"></a>Why is Instagram Polls Important?</h2><p>It doesn’t matter if you are managing your own or a brand’s profile, Instagram Polls can help you in more ways than you can think of.

To post Instagram poll questions, you simply need an active Instagram account. You can post an Instagram poll for your entire audience to see, set selective audience, or even DM it to someone. To learn how to do a poll on Instagram, just follow these steps:</p><h4 id="1-Create-your-Instagram-Story"><a href="#1-Create-your-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="1. Create your Instagram Story"></a>1. Create your Instagram Story</h4><p>At first, you can simply launch Instagram on your phone and go to the Story feature from the top-left corner. Once the dedicated interface of Instagram Story is launched, go to the “Create” section from its home to come up with an Instagram poll.</p><p>On the Create panel, simply swipe up to get options to insert questions, polls, countdowns, and so on. From here, tap on the “Poll” option, and its widget would be added on the screen that you can easily move around to position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tap-poll-option.jpg"                      alt="Tap Poll Option"                ></p><p>Now, you can just write a question that you wish to post on the poll and provide options for it. Instead of the default “Yes” and “No”, you can tap on these options and write any other choice.</p><h4 id="2-Customize-your-Instagram-Poll"><a href="#2-Customize-your-Instagram-Poll" class="headerlink" title="2. Customize your Instagram Poll"></a>2. Customize your Instagram Poll</h4><p>As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to do a poll on Instagram. Once you have entered the text for the poll and the options, you can customize your story as well. For instance, you can tap on the top panel to get different backgrounds for your poll or can even post it on a picture.</p><p>From here, you can also swipe up to get different widgets that you can further add to your Instagram Story. You can insert music, countdown, location, mention someone, or even add interesting GIFs and stickers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-instagram-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><p>Apart from that, you can write anything or even draw a pattern on your story to customize it the way you like.</p><h4 id="3-Post-your-Instagram-Poll"><a href="#3-Post-your-Instagram-Poll" class="headerlink" title="3. Post your Instagram Poll"></a>3. Post your Instagram Poll</h4><p>That’s it! Once you are satisfied with the editing of your Instagram Poll story, tap on the “Done” button from the top. Now, you can preview how your poll would look like and can tap on the “Send to” button. This will let you post your story for the entire audience or selective people.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-instagram-poll.jpg"                      alt="Post Instagram Poll"                ></p><p>Later, you can tap on your story and just swipe up to see the results. Instagram will let you know who voted for which option in the poll and you can also share the results of the poll on another Instagram Story from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-result-instagram-poll.jpg"                      alt="Result of Instagram Poll"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Creative-Instagram-Poll-Questions-and-Ideas"><a href="#Creative-Instagram-Poll-Questions-and-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas"></a>Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas</h2><p>By now, you would be able to understand how to do a poll on Instagram. Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.</p><ul><li><em>Asking about a location</em></li></ul><p>You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.</p><ul><li><em>Instagram Poll Questions on Food</em></li></ul><p>Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.</p><ul><li><em>This or That</em></li></ul><p>You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.</p><ul><li><em>Can you relate?</em></li></ul><p>These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.</p><ul><li><em>Love or Hate</em></li></ul><p>This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.</p><ul><li><em>Rating on a Scale</em></li></ul><p>Apart from a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question. Your audience can just slide the scale (from zero to max) and let you know how much they like&#x2F;dislike anything.</p><ul><li><em>Do you agree?</em></li></ul><p>You can also see a lot of poll questions for Instagram in this pattern. Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it.

Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!

The only solution to this issue is to crop the video and change its aspect ratio so it fits one of the commonly used aspect ratios on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download Filmora and Import the file into the software</strong></p><p>In order to start cropping your videos, you first must install the Filmora video editing software on your computer. Open the video editor in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, and then click on the Import drop-down menu and select the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Drag and Drop the video file onto the Timeline</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Now that the video clip you want to edit is in the editor’s media library, drag it and drop it to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop videos for Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>1. Landscape (16:9)</strong></p><p>Chances are that the camera you used to record your video clip recorded the footage in the landscape aspect ratio. Before you can export your video clip, you must first check the resolution and frame rate of the clip you want to export. Right-click on the clip in the media panel and select Properties. After you found out this information, click on the Export button located just below the media panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="check aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Once the new window appears, you should click on the Format icon positioned in the upper left corner of the screen. Select the MP4 format, name your file and select the folder where the file will be exported.</p><p>Click on the Settings button and then set the Quality of the video to Best and select the HD Optimized option in the Encoder menu. Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio. Once you made the calculations return to Filmora and click on the Manually option in the Crop and Pan screen. Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-visionary-video-conclave/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Visionary Video Conclave</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-elevate-your-content-how-to-edit-instagrams-preferred-format-in-fcpx/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Content How to Edit Instagram's Preferred Format in FCPX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-unleash-creativity-angled-rotation-mastery-for-youtube-vids/"><u>[New] Unleash Creativity Angled Rotation Mastery for YouTube Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-diy-ig-videos-tips-and-template-inspirations/"><u>[Updated] DIY IG Videos Tips & Template Inspirations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-ffxp-the-user-manual/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating FFXP The User Manual</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-instagram-video-edits-ultimate-tutorial-guide/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Instagram Video Edits Ultimate Tutorial Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-endless-preservation-of-instagrams-free-and-easy/"><u>2024 Approved Endless Preservation of Instagrams, Free & Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/elite-architects-best-of-breed-instragram-hlv-artisans-for-2024/"><u>Elite Architects Best-of-Breed Instragram HLV Artisans for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-vivo-s18-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Vivo S18 Pro Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/how-to-securely-download-and-update-graphics-drivers-on-your-toshiba-satellite-laptop-with-windows-os/"><u>How to Securely Download and Update Graphics Drivers on Your Toshiba Satellite Laptop with Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-flashlight-from-apple-iphone-8-lock-screen-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove Flashlight From Apple iPhone 8 Lock Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-webmaster.techidaily.com/1726030332610-mp3/"><u>インスタレート動画からMP3ファイルへの変換方法:詳しく解説</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151893/7443" target="_top" id="2151893">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151893" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151893/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next. Now, share it with reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="share instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>Since the playback speed is not the only factor responsible for making videos look really slow-motion, it is equally important to ensure that your shots have an ample amount of action and motion in them. This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section. For instance, if you want the first 20 seconds of video to be a slow motion at the speed of 0.3x, then select as shown below.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-part-of-instagram-reels-slow-motion-recording.jpg"                      alt="start part of instagram reels slow motion recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1498635">                    <video width="320" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1498635">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1498635.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:200px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1498635%2F17326'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1498635/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>And record the video till 40 seconds are left and stop.

It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136619/26400" target="_top" id="2136619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136619/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next.

This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about!

Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.</p><p> We’ve gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let’s start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.</p><h2 id="Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas"><a href="#Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas"></a>Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas</h2><p> Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.</p><ul><li><strong>Cityscapes and Landscapes</strong></li></ul><p> There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don’t feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-lightning-lanes-moving-iphone-photos-to-pc/"><u>[New] Lightning Lanes Moving iPhone Photos to PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-streamlining-video-uploads-tips-for-transforming-h-vids-for-igtv/"><u>[New] Streamlining Video Uploads Tips for Transforming H-Vids for IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-cutting-edge-gear-for-aspiring-youtube-stars-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cutting-Edge Gear for Aspiring YouTube Stars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-gopros-hero5-up-against-yis-high-res-adventures/"><u>[Updated] GoPro's Hero5 Up Against Yi's High-Res Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-androids-screen-shutter-select-the-best-eight-free-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Android's Screen Shutter - Select the Best Eight Free Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-spotlight-the-25-influencers-redefining-engagement/"><u>[Updated] Spotlight The 25 Influencers Redefining Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-year-ahead-exploring-instagrams-innovative-filters/"><u>2024 Approved The Year Ahead Exploring Instagram's Innovative Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location-on-honor-x9b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Honor X9b? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-contacts-from-motorola-edge-40-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to recover deleted contacts from Motorola Edge 40.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-next-gen-talents-8-youtube-channels-taking-off/"><u>In 2024, Next-Gen Talents 8 YouTube Channels Taking Off</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-blueprint-for-social-success-six-proven-steps-toward-verification-and-growth/"><u>In 2024, The Blueprint for Social Success Six Proven Steps Toward Verification and Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/innovating-computation-the-leading-5-hardware-advancements-in-ai-field/"><u>Innovating Computation: The Leading 5 Hardware Advancements in AI Field</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-poco-x5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Poco X5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/securing-your-social-snapshot-instagram-edition-for-2024/"><u>Securing Your Social Snapshot Instagram Edition for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

We’ll look at online solutions, browser add-ons which can work as Instagram image downloader tools and smartphone apps which do the same. Enjoy!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Free online solutions</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Browser add-ons</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: App solutions for your smartphone</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions</h3><h4 id="1-iGram"><a href="#1-iGram" class="headerlink" title="1. iGram:"></a>1. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://igram.io/" >iGram: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>This web-based Instagram picture downloader can grab all the images associated with a single post. To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. Inflact:"></a>5. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/" >Inflact: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools. Here are five of the best ones out there for you to try.</p><h4 id="1-IG-Downloader"><a href="#1-IG-Downloader" class="headerlink" title="1.

It works with Chrome and is a free extension in the store.</p><h4 id="2-Downloader-for-Instagram"><a href="#2-Downloader-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="2. Downloader for Instagram:"></a>2. <strong>Downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>This Instagram photo downloader for Chrome claims to be the world’s easiest browser extension to download images and videos from Instagram. It supports stories downloads and mass downloads with one click, and also lets you upload photos from your PC too. It’s free, but right now it doesn’t allow video uploads from your PC, although the developers say they are working on that.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Video-Download"><a href="#3-Instagram-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="3. Instagram Video Download:"></a>3. <strong>Instagram Video Download:</strong></h4><p>If you’re more of a Firefox person, Instagram Video Download has got you covered. This add-on provides a direct download button for images and video on Instagram user pages and even adds a ‘save’ button to the images themselves, saving even more time when you’re browsing.</p><h4 id="4-Video-Downloader-Professional-for-Edge"><a href="#4-Video-Downloader-Professional-for-Edge" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Downloader Professional for Edge:"></a>4. <strong>Video Downloader Professional for Edge:</strong></h4><p>For those who are browsing with Microsoft’s own products, this Instagram video downloader add on is the app you need. It only works with video at the moment, but you can use it on Vimeo and YouTube as well, and of course it’s free.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram-Downloader"><a href="#5-Instagram-Downloader" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram Downloader:"></a>5. <strong>Instagram Downloader:</strong></h4><p>With a hugely loyal following, Opera remains one of the world’s biggest browsers, so we had to include an offering for these guys too. This app to save Instagram videos and images lets you download all images or videos from a particular profile at once, as well as adding a button to individual photos and videos to enable single item downloading too.</p><p>Whichever browser floats your boat, these browser add-ons make Instagram image downloading super simple.

Video downloader for Instagram:"></a>1. <strong>Video downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>We’ll admit, it’s not the catchiest name, but hey, it does what it says on the tin! This Instagram video downloader is an easy to use, all in one solution that lets you not only download videos and images from Instagram, but also to copy the associated hashtags. It’s free too and scores an impressive 4.8 out of five from almost a quarter of a million reviews.</p><h4 id="2-QuickSave"><a href="#2-QuickSave" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickSave:"></a>2. <strong>QuickSave:</strong></h4><p>We love the design of the dashboard on this app to save Instagram videos, as it makes organizing your downloaded content super simple. The downloads are fast, and it works on both video and static photos too. There’s no charge to download it but do test it thoroughly as there have been reports of crashes on some devices.</p><h4 id="3-Regrann-–-Repost-for-Instagram"><a href="#3-Regrann-–-Repost-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="3. Regrann – Repost for Instagram:"></a>3. <strong>Regrann – Repost for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>This handy little app works as an Instagram photo downloader and also a reposting tool. It removes any watermarks from the images, which is useful or slightly naughty, depending on your intent. It’s free to buy, and you can upgrade to the pro version to make use of the post scheduling functionality too.</p><h4 id="4-IV-Saver"><a href="#4-IV-Saver" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can get the full profile details from Instagram, and there’s no log in required to use it. Again, it’s free, but with in app purchases to add functionality.</p><h4 id="5-Downloader-for-Instagram"><a href="#5-Downloader-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Downloader for Instagram:"></a>5. <strong>Downloader for Instagram:</strong></h4><p>Another app to save Instagram videos and photos who could have done with a better copywriter at the time of naming the app, but nevertheless it’s a solid contender as a downloading tool.

For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.</p><p>The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post&#x2F;Reels&#x2F;Feed.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Tap on Manage Option</strong></p><p>The initial step is to select or capture a photo&#x2F;video.

As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the <strong>Drag to hide</strong> option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/arrange-hide-instagram-filters.jpg"                      alt="arrange ins  filters"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap Done</strong></p><p>Once you have made the required adjustments, tap on the <strong>Done</strong> option present at the top right corner of the screen.

Today Instagram stories have become more popular than the OG Snapchat. Instagram stories are a great feature to share your journey with your followers. However, the stories are temporary and only last for 24 hours.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4.

How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic. However, the question is, how to make Instagram highlight covers?</p><p>No worries, here in this article, we will walk you through each step on how to create Instagram highlight covers.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions</h2><p>The highlight covers are small. Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle.

So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.</p><p>There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to follow on how to make highlight covers using the tool</p><p><strong>Step 1: Head over to canva.com or download the Canva App</strong></p><p>Once you are on the website, create your free account if you do not have one, and then log into your account.
