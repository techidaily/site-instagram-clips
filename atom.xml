The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed.

Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-1"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-1" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu.

Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

It is a platform where people enjoy getting socially involved a lot. From sharing happy moments of one’s life and texting friends to business activities, Instagram plays an important role in everyone’s life.</p><p>With a large number of users around the world, there is a sense of competition among the users and most of the videos posted on this platform are extraordinary. Instagram by default does not allow to download any of its content and hence sometimes the users will have to depend on some <strong>Instagram to MP4 converters</strong> to <strong>convert Instagram videos to mp4</strong> and download them.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic. However, the question is, how to make Instagram highlight covers?</p><p>No worries, here in this article, we will walk you through each step on how to create Instagram highlight covers.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions</h2><p>The highlight covers are small. Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight"                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16. However, ensure that that the illustration is centered when you add it as your Instagram highlight icon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-on-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-on-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?"></a>Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?</h2><p>Instagram allows you to use just about any image you like for your highlight covers. However, if you want your brand to stand out among the competition, you must get past just any image. Highlight covers are a prime space to attract visitors, turn them into customers, and leave a lasting impression. So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.</p><p>There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to follow on how to make highlight covers using the tool</p><p><strong>Step 1: Head over to canva.com or download the Canva App</strong></p><p>Once you are on the website, create your free account if you do not have one, and then log into your account. You can also download and install the Canva app on your iPhone or Android phone, and then log in to start using the app. In the following section, I will show you how to create the Instagram Story Highlight cover with Canva online.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Create a design for stories highlight cover</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-create-a-design-ins-story-highlight-cover.jpg"                      alt="Canva create a highlight cover design"                ></p><p>On the Canva homepage, click on <strong>Create a design</strong> tab at the right-hand upper corner.

Only the most influential and popular Instagrammers are the lucky ones to achieve it. Verification process just signifies authentication and is not designed to show any kind of status.</p><p> Yet, people want their Instagram account to get verified. Validation is a great way to let people easily find your account from numerous impersonated accounts.</p><p> However, it is definitely not an easy task to get verified on Instagram. In this article learn how to get verified on Instagram and get the blue tick for growing followers.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does Official Instagram Say</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Official-Instagram-Say"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Official-Instagram-Say" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?"></a>Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?</h2><p> Checking the <a class="link"   href="https://help.instagram.com/398038890351915" >help files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can give you the clear picture of the verification process of Instagram account.</p><p> The Instagram verified badge is the confirmation of the account being an authentic one. Whether a global brand, public figure or celebrity, a badge represents the genuineness of the account.</p><p> As the celebs and brands are the most followed ones and people would always like to find them instantanuously, Instagram ensures the community faces no issues while searching the right account of their most followed brands or celebs.</p><p> Instagram makes it very clear to the users that although Facebook owns Instagram, the two networking sites are not related to each other when it comes to followers or verifying the Instagram account.</p><p> According to Instagram policies, if you have several followers or if one can find you easily doesn’t qualify you for the Instagram blue tick. Only the accounts that are being copied or have high chances of being imitated or impersonated are the ones with the verified badges.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-Of-Instagram-Blue-Tick"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-Of-Instagram-Blue-Tick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick"></a>Part 2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick</h2><p> When you attain the Instagram blue tick, it means your account has been verified as authentic by the Instagram community.

Your account is at the top search results that build your account’s credibility. Whenever the question arises how to get verified on Instagram, several articles and write-ups inform that by building followers on the Instagram one can get easily verified.</p><p> This is a wrong notion and not completely correct. On the contrary, if you have lesser followers and more clones to your account, Instagram consider it as high priority account for verification and the Instagram blue tick follows. Huge followers are not everything when it comes to verifying the Instagram account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-followers.JPG"                      alt="ins followers"                ></p><h3 id="2-Focus-Parallel-Promotion"><a href="#2-Focus-Parallel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="2.

Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4.

Finally, the users of one of the largest social networks ever created can post videos that last longer than sixty seconds, although there are a number of limitations. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Uploading a video to Instagram TV, or IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a straightforward process, but at the moment you can only add vertically oriented videos to your IGTV channel. That’s why we’ve decided to show you several quick and easy ways of resizing and rotating your videos so that each video you share on IGTV fits the platform’s demands perfectly.</p><h3 id="Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine"><a href="#Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine" class="headerlink" title="Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine"></a>Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine</h3><p>Recently, video marketing has become an unstoppable trend. Celebrities and businesses earn great fortune through high-quality marketing videos. To join the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >profitable video marketing era <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can create your own IGTV marketing videos now!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-marketing-videos.png"                      alt="create marketing videos"                ></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos?

[PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]"></a>Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos? [PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]</h2><p>At the moment, IGTV only supports videos with aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 to 9:16</strong>, so if you recorded a video in any other aspect ratio you will have to change it before you share it on your IGTV channel. Moreover, the maximum size of a video file that lasts up to ten minutes is limited to just <strong>650MB</strong>, and the chances are that you will have to change the file’s size in order to be able to upload it to IGTV. Let’s have a look at some of the most effective ways of reformatting your IGTV videos.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers"><a href="#Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers"></a>Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers</h4><p>Changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of a video file in Filmora is easy. After you launch Wondershare’s video editor, you’ll have the option to <strong>create a new project</strong> or continue working on a project you already created. Once Filmora’s main window appears on the screen you just have to go to the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.</p><p>You can then change the resolution or choose a different frame rate. It is best to pick the <strong>1080X1920 (9:16 Portrait) option</strong> since the files exported in 2160X3840 (9:16 Portrait) resolution can end up being too large for the IGTV platform. Click on the OK button to confirm the adjustments you’ve made, and proceed to edit your video.</p><p>In case the process of changing a video’s aspect ratio and resolution is too complicated for you, Filmora offers an even simpler way of reformatting footage. Simply <strong>import a video</strong> into the video editor, and then <strong>place it on a video track on the timeline</strong>. <strong>Right-click on the file</strong> and select the <strong>Crop and Zoom option</strong> from the menu, or alternatively, just use the left mouse click to select a video you added to the timeline and use the <strong>Alt+C keyboard shortcut</strong> to access the <strong>Crop and Zoom window</strong>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ratio drop-down menu</strong> and choose the <strong>9:16 option</strong>, and then <strong>position the Crop rectangle over the area of the video you’d like to keep</strong>. Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos"></a>7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts"></a>9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts</h4><p>There is something strangely satisfying about watching others open gifts or things they got in the mail. This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?

They believe that fake likes on Instagram will provide greater exposure at a faster rate. Indeed, brands are more likely to work with someone who has 1,000 likes instead of 100 on a picture. That is why fake like buying has become such a popular idea among influencers.</p><p> But it is not recommended for influencers to buy fake likes on Instagram. If you are considering this option to boost your profile, please give the following points a read through before you make a final decision.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Why Do Influencers Buy Fake Likes</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-Influencers-Buy-Fake-Likes"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-Influencers-Buy-Fake-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do Influencers Buy Fake Likes?"></a>Part 1: Why Do Influencers Buy Fake Likes?</h2><p> Before 2016, the most important factor for an Instagram influencer was their follower count. But the platform began to <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-influencer-vacations/" >care more about engagement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of followers, which is why brands are very interested in the likes that you are getting on each post.</p><p> Now people think about buying likes if they feel their engagement levels are not rising quickly enough for them to get more exposure or interesting sponsorship offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-why-buy-fake-likes.JPG"                      alt="why buy fake likes"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes"><a href="#Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes"></a>Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes</h2><h3 id="1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement"><a href="#1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="1. It Will Harm Your Engagement"></a>1. It Will Harm Your Engagement</h3><p> When you have more followers on Instagram, it is inevitable that your engagement levels will decline. When an account has less than 1,000 followers, the engagement levels are around eight percent. It goes down to four percent when you have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. Between 10,000 to 100,000 followers has an engagement level of around 2.4%. And it goes down to 1.7% when you are at a million.</p><p> What do all these numbers mean? It means that if you were to buy likes, you would be arousing suspicion of brands who may want to hire you for sponsorship purposes. Say you are buying a lot of likes because they are cheaper to get than followers. If you have 15,000 followers and an engagement level of 6 or 7 percent, your account is suspicious.</p><h2 id="2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole"><a href="#2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole" class="headerlink" title="2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole"></a>2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole</h2><p> It is so easy to think that you will be purchasing fake likes on Instagram for one or two uses. “I just want to promote a couple of my posts to gain exposure.” These are the words that every like buyer utters. A month later, they are furiously buying likes for every single post they put up on Instagram.</p><p> It is a vicious cycle, because you become addicted to those bought likes. And if you are doing all this to impress brands, you must keep up your engagement levels or they will assume you had a post go viral, which is not necessarily indicative of a popular account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-rules.JPG"                      alt="ins fake likes"                ></p><h3 id="3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules"><a href="#3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules" class="headerlink" title="3. Violation of Instagram Rules"></a>3. Violation of Instagram Rules</h3><p> Instagram has very strict guidelines and rules of engagement. Buying likes and followers is against those rules. Of course, they are not going to strike down every single account that buys likes and followers. If they did, it would completely stop as a practice.</p><p> But there is a good chance that you will get caught eventually. And the risk is that your entire account is deleted, including all your followers, likes and posts. You may have a hard time opening up another account with the same identity.</p><p> And many of the sites that offer like buying services get shut down, which instantly impacts the likes you get on your next posts. It can turn into a race of you buying more likes from other sellers, until they get shut down too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes"></a>Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes</h2><h3 id="1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off"><a href="#1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off" class="headerlink" title="1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off"></a>1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off</h3><p> There can be anomalies in how many likes an Instagram post gets relative to the account’s followers. For instance, a post may be shared by an influencer and celebrity, causing it to go viral.</p><p> But accounts that have multiple posts with engagement levels of 9 or 10 percent, or even higher, are immediately suspicious. It is not probable for an account to have such a high level of engagement without some like buying.</p><p> Those who are insistent on buying likes will need to buy followers to match up the engagement levels with the numbers we mentioned above. But it is more hassle than it is worth!</p><h3 id="2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up"><a href="#2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up" class="headerlink" title="2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up"></a>2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up</h3><p> When an account has very few posts, but any likes on each post, it is unusual. It generally takes a lot of posts before an account can rack up a high follower and like count. The only time accounts with few posts have a lot of likes is when they are started by a celebrity.</p><p> If you notice an influencer has three or four posts in the past month, but they have thousands of likes on each post, it is suspicious. There is a good chance the influencer used inauthentic methods of gaining those likes.</p><h3 id="3-Spam-Comments"><a href="#3-Spam-Comments" class="headerlink" title="3. Spam Comments"></a>3. Spam Comments</h3><p> Ever noticed that some Instagram accounts are dominated by spam comments? You may see two or three genuine-sounding comments in the section. Everything else is some version of “follow me” or a single word phrase. It is indicative of an account where likes, followers and comments are bought.</p><p> Influencers think they can trick people into buying their engagement levels with spam comments. But companies that care about where they spend their marketing budget will do research that goes beyond a cursory glance at the number of followers, likes and comments. They will notice spam comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-spam-comment.JPG"                      alt="spam comment"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Instagram is about so much more than showing off your latest look or meal. It is a platform dominated by influencers, which is why brands are so interested in leveraging it for their own success. Influencers get tempted to buy likes so they can raise their profile and attract better sponsorship offers.</p><p> But purchasing likes on Instagram is a complex process that is fairly easy to spot. Unless you want to go down a black hole of constantly buying likes and followers, it is best to focus your efforts on organically growing your follower count and engagement levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamlined-social-media-management-our-picks-of-the-best-8-planners/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamlined Social Media Management  Our Picks of the Best 8 Planners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/ownership-guidelines-for-instagram-music-for-2024/"><u>Ownership Guidelines for Instagram Music for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-incorporate-live-captions-seamlessly-into-stories/"><u>[Updated] Incorporate Live Captions Seamlessly Into Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-frame-it-right-mastering-instagram-video-edges/"><u>2024 Approved  Frame It Right  Mastering Instagram Video Edges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-instagram-savvy-strategists-guide-to-understanding-engagement-figures/"><u>2024 Approved  The Instagram Savvy Strategist’s Guide to Understanding Engagement Figures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-sounding-superior-a-guide-to-altering-voice-on-reels-and-stories/"><u>[New] Sounding Superior  A Guide to Altering Voice on Reels & Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-spotlight-10-anonymous-story-gazers/"><u>2024 Approved  Spotlight 10 Anonymous Story Gazers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-on-infinix-smart-8-hdwithwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock on Infinix Smart 8 HDwith/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/what-you-want-to-know-about-two-factor-authentication-for-icloud-from-your-apple-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>What You Want To Know About Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud From your Apple iPhone XS Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/achieving-cost-free-online-educational-streaming-for-2024/"><u>Achieving Cost-Free Online Educational Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-captivating-content-for-a-consistent-climb-in-subscribers/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Captivating Content for a Consistent Climb in Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/unlock-enhanced-video-playback-and-app-functionality-with-chromes-pip-for-2024/"><u>Unlock Enhanced Video Playback and App Functionality with Chrome’s PIP for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-are-you-finding-it-challenging-to-upload-and-create-a-link-for-your-video-well-this-detailed-upload-video-to-link-guide-will-help-you-with-this-chec/"><u>In 2024, Are You Finding It Challenging to Upload and Create a Link for Your Video?

Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view. The number of views a video gets indicates the total number of people who interacted with it, even for a period of time that is as brief as a couple of seconds.</p><p><strong>Engagements –</strong> This metric shows you the combined number of likes and comments a video has at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention –</strong> A rather important statistic that tells you the percentage of all viewers who watched a video from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention Graph –</strong> A visual representation of the percentage of all views a video has at any moment. You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media. Do you think that audience retention or engagement rates can be essential for developing a viable online marketing strategy?

The latest buzz on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are the hilarious gender swap pictures that let you see how you would look like if you were a man or a woman. However, at the moment there are only a few apps that offer gender swap effects, so you must either use Snapchat or the FaceApp to swap genders. That is why in this article we are going to show you a few different methods of creating gender swap photos with these two apps.</p><h2 id="Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters"><a href="#Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters"></a>Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters</h2><p>Snapchat introduced three new filters that caught the attention of the crowd on social media because they highlight masculine or feminine characteristics of facial traits. The ‘man lens’ will make your jawline shaper, hair shorter and your beard longer, while the ‘woman lens’ makes your skin look softer or applies some makeup to your face. The ‘baby lens’ however, is by far the most popular of the three because it enables people to see how they would look like if they were less than six months old.</p><p>Taking a photo of yourself while any of these filters is enabled is a simple process that won’t take more than a few seconds. Launch the Snapchat app, then open the camera and switch to the phone’s front camera by tapping on the arrow icon at the top of the screen. Each of the gender swap filters should be within the top ten filters in the Snapchat’s filter collection, so just select the one you like and then take a photo. After you Tap on the Save button, the picture you’ve taken is going to be stored in the Snapchat memories.</p><h2 id="Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook"><a href="#Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook"></a>Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook</h2><p>At the moment Instagram and Facebook don’t offer gender swap filters to its users, and if you want to post a gender swap photo on these two social media you have to take a photo with another app. Sharing a picture you’ve taken with Snapchat on Facebook, Instagram or other social media is not complicated although it requires some time and effort. Once you’ve taken the photo with the man, women or baby lens you should tap on the icon that looks like two cards that is located at the bottom of the screen and select the gender swap picture you want to share on Instagram or Facebook. Take the screenshot of the photo you selected, and save it to your phone’s Camera Roll.</p><p>Launch the Instagram app and use its photo editing tools to crop out all unwanted parts of the picture or enhance its colors. You are not going to be able to edit your gender swap photo with the Facebook app, even though you can easily share the photo on your profile. Sadly there is no indication that either Facebook or Instagram are going to introduce new gender swap filters in the near future and Snapchat is still one of your best options if you want to create this type of photos.</p><h2 id="Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device"><a href="#Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device"></a>Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg"                      alt="Change Gender with FaceApp"                ></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341?mt=8" >FaceApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a strong alternative to the newly added gender swap effects on Snapchat because it offers more gender swap filters and it makes sharing the images on Facebook or Instagram much easier. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en" >GooglePlay Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must make in-app purchases if you want to unlock its Pro features. However, even the free version of the app utilizes Artificial Intelligence and neural nets to analyze a vast amount of images and use the findings to make your face look more masculine or more feminine.</p><p>The app’s users can either take new photos or edit the pictures they’ve taken with another app, but some filters are only available if you purchase a monthly or an annual subscription. The FaceApp lets you put on a new smile, swap genders or use the cool style filters to take better selfies. You can experiment with different looks and see how you’d look like if you were a Hollywood superstar or if you had a long blonde hair. Once you find the look that all of your friends must see, you can share the gender swap photo to Instagram or Facebook with a single tap.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking a swap gender photo is going to cheer up your day and give your friends on social media a good laugh. The number of apps you can use for this purpose may be somewhat limited, but either Snapchat or the FaceApp are powerful enough to enable you to create gender swap photos that gets hundreds of likes on social media.

But, even with so many people to engage with, many businesses are finding it hard. Changes to the algorithm have affected how many people are shown each post, and the introduction of Instagram business accounts is reported to have had a negative impact on those unwilling to pay for exposure.</p><p>Finding out how to gain followers on Instagram is well worth an investment of your time. Research has shown that users want to engage with you in meaningful ways, such as calling you, visiting your website, or seeking directions to your premises. In fact, <a class="link"   href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/welcoming-1-million-advertisers" >more than 120 million Instagrammers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> do this every month. If you don’t care about how to get IG followers, you’re missing out on a golden business opportunity.</p><p>Our ultimate guide to how to get more followers on IG is designed to help you explore new ways of connecting with interested parties. There’s no guaranteed method of how to increase followers on Instagram, but there are ways you can increase your potential for attracting new fans. Here, you can find insightful top tips on how to get more followers on IG so that your business can start to make ripples in your industry.</p><h2 id="Top-tips-on-how-to-gain-more-followers-on-Instagram"><a href="#Top-tips-on-how-to-gain-more-followers-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Top tips on how to gain more followers on Instagram"></a>Top tips on how to gain more followers on Instagram</h2><p>Here we’ll bring you our very best top tips on how to get more IG followers so that you can leverage the full power of the world’s biggest photo-sharing platform.</p><h3 id="1-Make-it-easy-for-users-to-find-you"><a href="#1-Make-it-easy-for-users-to-find-you" class="headerlink" title="1. Make it easy for users to find you"></a>1. Make it easy for users to find you</h3><p>You could have the best images, the most insightful content, and work as hard as you like on your account, but if users can’t find you, it will all be for nothing. If your fans don’t know you’re there, they are never going to follow you.</p><p>To increase your visibility, use the tools you already have in place. If you have a fan base on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network, cross-promote your Instagram page with those people, encouraging them to follow you. Consider paying to boost these posts to ensure even more of your existing fans are driven towards your Instagram account.</p><p>You can also place a link on your website to help visitors find you on Instagram and could consider including a link in your email signatures and other public-facing profiles. When you’re keen to discover how to increase followers on Instagram, maximizing the use of existing resources is a no-brainer.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-your-profile"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your profile"></a>2. Optimize your profile</h3><p>You want your profile to be a powerful piece of marketing, so don’t scrimp on your time investment here either. Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date. Take a look at the profiles of some of your competition to see what’s working for them, then you can make improvements to your own.</p><h3 id="3-Tell-a-consistent-story"><a href="#3-Tell-a-consistent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. Tell a consistent story"></a>3. Tell a consistent story</h3><p>Consistency and regularity are the keys to how to get more followers on IG. Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas. Your visuals should be instantly recognizable at a glance and should present a cohesive narrative across this social channel.</p><h3 id="4-Use-hashtags"><a href="#4-Use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="4. Use hashtags"></a>4. Use hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags are one of the best ways of how to increase followers on IG. Good use of powerful, relevant hashtags will expose your posts to people who are not followers of your page, but who are interested in the kind of content you are producing. When you start using hashtags, achieve success quickly by:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking out the most popular:</strong> Have a look at popular hashtags for your industry. What are your competitors using? What about influencers in your niche?</li><li><strong>Using niche tags:</strong> Getting niche with your tags will grab the attention of a narrower audience, but one which is much more engaged with your business.</li><li><strong>Create your own tag:</strong> Use your own branded hashtag with your posts and promote it with contests and on other channels to get people starting to use it.</li><li><strong>Use enough hashtags:</strong> You can place up to 30 hashtags on any one post but using all 30 every time is probably a little too much. Research shows that between 9 – 11 hashtags tend to be the optimal number, but this will vary by industry.</li><li><strong>Avoid spammy hashtags:</strong> Don’t be tempted into using #like4like or #followback type tags, as although you may find you get more followers, they will be low quality and not really interested in your content.</li></ul><p>Find out more about using hashtags in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use hashtags on Instagram. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post"><a href="#5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post" class="headerlink" title="5. Pick the right time to post"></a>5. Pick the right time to post</h3><p>Posting consistently is one hurdle to overcome; refining the times at which you post is another. An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day. Use a scheduling tool to plan and organize your posts, but also make sure someone is available to respond to comments when the post goes live.</p><p>Check our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >When is The Best Time to Post on Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Guide to know more.</p><h3 id="6-Tag-other-users"><a href="#6-Tag-other-users" class="headerlink" title="6. Tag other users"></a>6. Tag other users</h3><p>Adding a specific user’s tag to your posts will encourage them to share it too, helping to expose your business to more new people. When working on how to get more IG followers, engaging with specific influencers is crucial. However, don’t just go randomly tagging them, as this is unlikely to get the desired response. Engage with them through their own posts, and then use this relationship to help grow your own following.</p><p>You can also get users to tag other users in your posts. Captions such as ‘tag someone who feels like this on a Monday’ or ‘tag the person you’d love to be on this beach with’ will get people tagging their friends like mad. Suddenly you’re exposed to many other Instagram users and have started to build your following even more.</p><h3 id="7-Run-a-competition"><a href="#7-Run-a-competition" class="headerlink" title="7. Run a competition"></a>7. Run a competition</h3><p>Contests and competitions are one of the best ways to find out how to get IG followers. There are many ways you can run your contest, from getting people to use a specific hashtag to asking them to comment, like, or follow your account. You don’t need to be a multibillion-dollar business to run a competition successfully, but it does need to be of high enough value to encourage interaction.</p><p>Some ideas for a competition could be:</p><ul><li>Win a fashion voucher by sharing images of the perfect work outfit</li><li>Win a camera for sharing pictures of inspirational locations</li><li>A draw to win an iPad which is entered by liking &#x2F; following your account</li><li>A merchandise goody bag for tagging a friend you’d bring to your restaurant</li></ul><p>Competitions can be great fun, so get creative and think of some exciting offers and engagement opportunities for your specific brand.</p><h3 id="8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video"><a href="#8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video" class="headerlink" title="8. Get to grips with live video"></a>8. Get to grips with live video</h3><p>Livestreaming is huge right now, on all social platforms, and Instagram is no different. It’s the ideal way to share coverage of a conference, a trade show, a training opportunity or to run a Q&amp;A session. You could showcase your factory, do a tour of your offices, cover the opening of your new store… anything really.</p><p>Live streams on Instagram appear at the top of your follower’s feeds, making it an ideal way to engage deeply with those who already follow you. Encourage viewers to tag their friends, perhaps by running a giveaway as part of the video. Users who are online when you start broadcasting will be instantly notified of your live stream, making it a great way to really grab people’s attention.</p><p>You can choose to have your stream disappear as soon as it’s been completed or to have it available in your brand’s story area for 24 hours. Your story also appears at the top of your follower’s feeds, offering you a great opportunity to engage with those who missed the live stream itself.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Go Live On Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="9-Use-Instagram-ads"><a href="#9-Use-Instagram-ads" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Instagram ads"></a>9. Use Instagram ads</h3><p>If you’re serious about how to get more followers on IG, making use of Instagram ads is going to be important for you. These allow you to reach out to new followers rapidly, presenting your carefully crafted content to people who may never have heard of you before.</p><p>Using the advertising tools built into Instagram, you can make your ads highly targeted too. Pick who you want to see your ads based on interests and behaviors, demographics, geographic locations, and a swathe of other parameters to help you reach the right people. You are able to advertise in both Instagram feeds and in stories, so explore all your options and test different strategies to see what works best for your business.</p><h3 id="10-Use-Instagram-insights"><a href="#10-Use-Instagram-insights" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Instagram insights"></a>10. Use Instagram insights</h3><p>Instagram was the last social network to really get on board with providing data, but thank goodness they do now, and we should all be using it to discover how to gain followers on Instagram. The analytics and insights provided by Instagram are absolute marketing gold dust, so take the time to get to grips with what you can discover to continue to grow your following.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Analytics Tools for Better Tracking Your Metrics &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can view insights for your whole account using the chart button on the top right of your profile page, or for an individual post by navigating to that post and clicking ‘view insights’ in the bottom left. When you visit Insights for your account, you’ll see:</p><ul><li><strong>Impressions:</strong> How many times your ad or content appeared on feeds</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many unique users have seen your posts</li><li><strong>Clicks:</strong> A count of the times people have clicked any link you’ve added to your business profile</li><li><strong>Visits:</strong> How many times your profile page has been looked at</li><li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many followers you’ve acquired or lost in the last week</li></ul><p>The ‘followers’ section will also tell you what times of day your followers are most active, which is highly informative when it comes to planning your posting times. If you choose to view insights for a particular post, you’ll be able to see:</p><ul><li><strong>Likes:</strong> How many like your post generated</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> How many comments were left</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> How many users saved or bookmarked your post</li><li><strong>Actions:</strong> How many actions were taken, such as visiting your profile, following you or clicking a link to your website</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> This metric shows where your post was seen the most, including how many accounts were not following you when they first saw you post</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, when you start drilling down into these metrics and keeping a record of data over a period of time, it’s easy to see patterns beginning to emerge. These patterns will be crucial to tailoring your strategy as you move forward, and to ensure you know how to gain followers on Instagram ongoing.</p><p>So now you know some of the right ways of how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get more followers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on IG. However, there is one way of how to get IG followers which we have not mentioned, and that’s by buying them. We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do. Knuckle down, do things right and you’ll be growing your Instagram fanbase in no time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-peak-performance-on-instagram/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Peak Performance on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-enhance-your-watch-experience-with-faster-instagram-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhance Your Watch Experience with Faster Instagram Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-instaboomtown-building-community-with-loop-videos/"><u>In 2024, InstaBoomtown  Building Community with Loop Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-be-inspired-today-the-essentials-of-stunning-photos-on-ig/"><u>[New] Be Inspired Today!
