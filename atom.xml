There’s no need to worry about photo sizes or aspect ratios because Instagram is going to the all the heavy work for you.</p><p>Troubles begin when you want to upload photos and videos that weren’t captured with a Smartphone to Instagram. In most cases, the photos and videos produced by DSLR cameras and other semi-professional and professional equipment are much larger than the sizes supported by Instagram. That is the reason why we created this guide that will help you post visual content that is perfectly adjusted to Instagram in 2021.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram"><a href="#Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Types of Files Accepted by Instagram"></a>Types of Files Accepted by Instagram</h2><p>The first thing you need to pay attention to when uploading images and videos to Instagram is that the files you are uploading are in one of the photo or video formats that Instagram supports.</p><p><strong>Photo File Types</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Instagram supports only two file formats. You should make sure that your photo is either saved in <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> file format because all other file formats won’t do the trick, and you’ll be forced to go back to the photo editor you used and change the file format before you can upload a photo to Instagram. Posting GIF files is not possible without apps such as GIPHY CAM or GifLab because this type of files isn’t supported by Instagram.</p><p><strong>Video File Types</strong></p><p>Things get much easier when it comes to video since Instagram supports nearly all video file formats you can think of. However, the most commonly used types of video files uploaded to Instagram are have an  codec and a MP.4 file extension, which is the reason why we recommend converting your video files into this file format before uploading them to Instagram.</p><p>Duration of Videos on Instagram</p><p>You can either upload a video to Instagram’s main feed or you can upload it as a story. If you decide to upload a video to the main feed, the time limit is set at just 60 seconds, while the length of a video in an Instagram story cannot exceed 15 seconds.</p><h2 id="Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts"><a href="#Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts"></a>Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts</h2><p>A couple of years ago, Instagram has finally allowed its users to upload images that aren’t square shaped. In 2021, you can also upload horizontally and vertically oriented photos in addition to the standard square shape. However, in order to create a perfect Instagram post, and prevent the platform from cropping your photos you need to use the Instagram image sizes featured below.</p><h4 id="Instagram’s-Main-Feed"><a href="#Instagram’s-Main-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Instagram’s Main Feed"></a>Instagram’s Main Feed</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-sizes-infographic-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>The main feed on Instagram is the place where all the posts from people you are following on this platform are displayed. So let’s take a look at the perfect Instagram photo sizes for the main feed.</p><ul><li><strong>Square</strong></li></ul><p>Most digital cameras don’t produce this shape of a photo, which means that you’ll have to change width and height values before you upload a photo to Instagram. The best Instagram photo size for square-shaped images is 1080 px X 1080 px in 1:1 aspect ratio because if you use a picture that has fewer or more pixels than that, the platform may resize your photo automatically.</p><ul><li><strong>Landscape</strong></li></ul><p>This type of picture orientation is frequently used for both videos and photos, however, if you want to upload a horizontally oriented photo to Instagram, we recommend that you use 1,91:1 aspect ratio and 1080 px X 566 px values for the size of a photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Portrait</strong></li></ul><p>Portrait or vertically oriented photos on Instagram should have 8:10 aspect ratio and a 1080 px size value for the shorter side of a photo, and 1350 px value for the longer side of a photo you’d like to post to Instagram.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Stories"><a href="#Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Stories"></a>Instagram Stories</h4><p>The photos you post as stories on Instagram are always vertically oriented and for that reason, you should change their aspect ratio to 9:16 and set their size to 1080X1920px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Profile-Pictures"><a href="#Instagram-Profile-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Profile Pictures"></a>Instagram Profile Pictures</h4><p>The profile pictures on Instagram are tiny, and the optimum size for them is 160X160 px, while their shape is always a square which means that you’ll have to set their aspect ratio to 1:1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The Slow-motion feature allows users to create entertaining videos by transforming ordinary objects into something extraordinary and unique. Instagram lets you make reels with a variety of special effects. We will now show you how to use Instagram Reels to create Slow-motion videos.</p><p>Slow motion video recording has gotten incredibly simple on Instagram reels. Without the need for any other pricey software, the video may be slowed down easily and rapidly online. Now you can adjust the playing speed and experiment with it. Follow these simple steps to make your Reels video:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option"></a>Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option</h3><p>Launch the Instagram app. Once the main page opens, select the <strong>plus icon</strong> showing on the bottom end of the page.

The setting is set to 1x speed, which is the default speed setting. Now, if you want to record a slow-motion video, set the setting from 0.3x to 0.5x according to your preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-video-speed-options.jpg"                      alt="Create Instagram Reels Slow motion video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Start-Recording"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Recording"></a>Step 3: Start Recording</h3><p>Now that you’ve adjusted the speed, click on the <strong>Record</strong> button to begin recording your video.

Instagram now also features the ability to record only a portion of a video that you want to slow down. You don’t have to record your Reels video all at once. You can also record it in shorter clips. Then you may combine all the short snippets to make a whole slow-motion video. This allows you to record a video at a quicker rate while recording all other videos at a standard rate. Only a piece of your movie will play at a sluggish speed, while the remainder will go nicely.</p><ol><li><strong>Why can’t I upload a slow motion video on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>To upload a slow-mo video on Instagram, you must first alter the video to a slow version and then save the video in a local file on your phones, because usually, you can save all types of videos on phones, but most phones don’t support a rendered version of a slow-mo video. After this, you should be able to upload the video directly to Instagram.</p><ol><li><strong>Besides slow motion, can I record fast-forward videos on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, you can. Instagram features a fast-forward option. Select the speed option to change the video’s speed to fast speed. You can set the video at three different fast-forward speed settings: 1x, 2x, and 3x. Now it has become very simple to record a fast-forward video on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-seamless-social-media-execution-with-the-top-8-iphone-and-android-apps-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Seamless Social Media Execution with The Top 8 iPhone & Android Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-incorporating-instagrams-cutting-edge-filters/"><u>[New] In 2024, Incorporating Instagram's Cutting Edge Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-easy-entryway-initiating-a-live-discussion-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Easy Entryway  Initiating a Live Discussion on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-social-media-sensation-making-your-vids-pop/"><u>In 2024, Social Media Sensation  Making Your Vids Pop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-brand-presence-effective-instagram-video-marketing-techniques/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Brand Presence  Effective Instagram Video Marketing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-through-instagrams-video-time-slot/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Through Instagram's Video Time Slot</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instas-tunes-ownership-and-legalities/"><u>2024 Approved  Insta's Tunes  Ownership & Legalities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-tips-on-syncing-gmail-and-zoom-for-remote-collaboration/"><u>2024 Approved  Expert Tips on Syncing Gmail and Zoom for Remote Collaboration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-speech-to-text-conversion-methods/"><u>New Speech-to-Text Conversion Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-youtube-thumbnail-size-you-should-knowthe-ultimate-guide/"><u>In 2024, Best YouTube Thumbnail Size You Should Know[The Ultimate Guide]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/foremost-websites-accelerating-youtube-traffic/"><u>Foremost Websites Accelerating YouTube Traffic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-simplified-path-getting-snapchat-on-macos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Simplified Path  Getting Snapchat on macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-the-world-of-haul-and-try-on-vlogging/"><u>In 2024, Navigating the World of Haul and Try-On Vlogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-itel-a05s-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Ultimate Fixes for Google Play Your Itel A05s Isnt Compatible | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-virtualdub-exploring-the-best-video-editing-software-alternatives-for-2024/"><u>Updated Beyond Virtualdub Exploring the Best Video Editing Software Alternatives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-gopro-tips-and-tricks/"><u>[Updated] Gopro Tips and Tricks</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world.

If you upload large images, Instagram will crop them while publishing small images will make them be enlarged.</p><p>Before getting into the nitty-gritty of this article, it is prudent to understand the meaning of the key words concerning Instagram. These include video frame rate, aspect ratio, resolution and Image Size.</p><h2 id="Aspect-Ratio-Image-Size-Resolution-and-Video-Frame-Rate-Explained"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Image-Size-Resolution-and-Video-Frame-Rate-Explained" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio, Image Size, Resolution and Video Frame Rate Explained"></a>Aspect Ratio, Image Size, Resolution and Video Frame Rate Explained</h2><p><strong>Aspect ratio</strong>  refers to the ratio of the width of an image to height. To indicate the aspect ratio of an image we use ratios in the form of 1:1, 2:3 or 5:4 depending on the variants. Instagram aspect ratio of a vertical video is 9:16 while the horizontal ratio is 16:9.</p><p><strong>Image size</strong>  is the height and width of a photo or video in pixels. A standard cover photo for Instagram should be 420px by 654px. A pixel is the smallest area on a display screen.</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong>  is the number of pixels in a video or photo. It is the product of pixels on the width and height of the image. The minimum video resolution on Instagram is 720 pixels.</p><p><strong>Frame rate</strong>  is the rate at which individual images (frames) display on a screen per second and the initial is FPS. For Instagram to support your videos, the minimum frame rate should be 30FPS.</p><p>Since you can now interpret video dimensions and photo sizes like a pro, do you know the recommended video dimensions for Instagram for each format?</p><h2 id="Best-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-Specifications-for-a-Post"><a href="#Best-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-Specifications-for-a-Post" class="headerlink" title="Best Instagram Video Dimensions Specifications for a Post"></a>Best Instagram Video Dimensions Specifications for a Post</h2><p>Even though MP4 is the only supported Instagram video format, you can set the videos different orientations and forms. The main orientations are square, landscape (horizontal) and Portrait (vertical).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-video-format.jpg"                      alt="instagram video dimensions"                ></p><p>Since Instagram is not limited to videos, you might be puzzling about the required dimensions for Instagram photos, stories, IGTV, live videos and other supported features like ads. Keep calm, and find all the Instagram dimensions and sizes right in here.</p><p>Other than just uploading ordinary videos and sharing photos, you can also <strong>tell a story on Instagram</strong>  using videos and photos in a slideshow format. For business purposes, you can format Instagram stories to <strong>create Instagram Carousel ads</strong>  to use as an advert.</p><p>To realize the real importance of Instagram, start using the <strong>video ads feature</strong> , uploading <strong>IGTV videos</strong>  and <strong>streaming live videos</strong> . As you explore all these features, remember to use the specified Max Instagram video dimensions in this article.</p><h3 id="1-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-And-Sizes"><a href="#1-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-And-Sizes" class="headerlink" title="#1 - Instagram Video Dimensions And Sizes"></a>#1 - Instagram Video Dimensions And Sizes</h3><p>To optimize these Instagram video orientations, here are the dimensional specifications you need to know:</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Videos"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Videos"></a>Instagram Square Videos</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-videos.jpg"                      alt="best video dimensions for instagram"                ></p><p>Since the launch of Instagram video sharing feature, square videos are the most successful orientation. To occupy a larger space to attract more attention, we recommend square videos. Use the following Instagram square video dimensions to produce high-quality videos.</p><ul><li>Maximum Instagram file size is 4GB</li><li>The aspect ratio should be 1:1 with minimum dimension of 600px by 600px and a maximum of 1080px by 1080px.</li><li>Video codecs should be , VP8</li><li>Maximum frame rate is 30fps</li></ul><h4 id="Instagram-Horizontal-Videos-Landscape"><a href="#Instagram-Horizontal-Videos-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Horizontal Videos (Landscape)"></a>Instagram Horizontal Videos (Landscape)</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-horizontal-videos.jpg"                      alt="instagram video format"                ></p><p>Even though recording Instagram videos in a landscape form is a lot much easier, the majority of Instagram enthusiasts despise. It is the least used orientation mostly because it occupies a small space and the quality appears distorted.</p><p>To recorded landscape videos, set the dimensions in the aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1.91:1. In a situation where shooting videos in the landscape is necessary, we recommend the 16:9 Instagram size ratio. The maximum dimensions should be set at 1080px by 607px, which is the set cinematic standard.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait"><a href="#Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)"></a>Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-vertical-videos.jpg"                      alt="instagram vertical video dimensions"                ></p><p>Vertical videos differ from square videos by very small margins. For your portrait videos to attract many viewers, ensure it is of the highest quality and has an aspect ratio of 4:5. This ratio has to coincide with a 1080px by 1350px dimension.</p><h3 id="2-Instagram-Story-Dimensions"><a href="#2-Instagram-Story-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#2 - Instagram Story Dimensions"></a>#2 - Instagram Story Dimensions</h3><p>Instagram story option started in 2016. According to <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/instagram-stories" >Buffer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to maintain story completion rate above 70%, your story frames should range from one to seven. Moreover, because Instagram stories last for 24 hours, use aspect ratio you are certain will display high-resolution frames.</p><p>Instagram story size is less stringed compared to the videos. Instagram allows its users to upload photos and videos for creating a story with an aspect ratio of between 1.91:1 and 9:16. Below or above these ratios, the story will have borders and thus affect its quality.</p><p>The best Instagram story size is be 1080px by 1920px.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Carousel-Ads-Dimensions"><a href="#3-Instagram-Carousel-Ads-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#3 - Instagram Carousel Ads Dimensions"></a>#3 - Instagram Carousel Ads Dimensions</h4><p>Just like the Instagram story, carousel ads are created from videos and images.

As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.</p><p>Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).</p><p>Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:</p><ul><li>Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px</li><li>Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px</li></ul><p>This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Portrait Photo Size"></a>Instagram Portrait Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story size"                ></p><p>For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.</p><p>Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Landscape Photo Size"></a>Instagram Landscape Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram post size"                ></p><p>How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.</p><p>Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.</p><p>You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.</p><p>If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.</p><h2 id="Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software"><a href="#Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software"></a>Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software</h2><p>The best method to publish high-quality Instagram videos and photos is to edit them before publishing.</p><p>To share well-edit photos and videos, it is good to use a video editor.

In order to increase the visibility of your posts on Instagram, you should strive to find the best time for sharing a post. The rule of thumb says that the best time to share a post on Instagram is when the majority of your followers is enjoying their free time because that is when they are most likely to use this social media platform. Generally speaking early mornings, lunch hours and evenings between 19:00 and 21:00 are the best times for posting on Instagram, but each year the best time for posting on Instagram changes.</p><p> Things are further complicated by the fact that each Instagram account has a unique set of followers, which means that the best time to share a post on Instagram may be different for two relatively similar accounts. In this article, we are going to show you how to find out when is the best time to post on Instagram, and we are going to recommend a few scheduling tools you are going to need if you want to make sure that your posts are always perfectly timed.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">The Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</a></li></ul><h2 id="The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>The Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-time-post-on-insta.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: mentionlytics.com</p><p> There is no recipe for success, but following certain guidelines can be useful if you want to extend the reach of your posts on Instagram. Despite the fact that social media researchers often come up with conflicting reports regarding the best time to share a post on Instagram, most of them agree that Mondays and Thursdays are the best days to post new content on Instagram.</p><p> Furthermore, several research studies suggest that Mondays are the most effective and that posts shared on this day of the week create better engagement and have better conversion rates. Thursdays, on the other hand, are the most popular day for posting content on Instagram, which suggests that your posts will have a better reach if you share them during the peak hours on this day of the week.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are no strict guidelines regarding the hours of the day, when it is best to post new content to Instagram on these days, but the time frame between 15:00 and 16:00 should be avoided during the working days of the week. Instagram’s algorithm favors posts that get a lot of likes and comments, but it also factors in the amount of time it takes a post to get those likes and comments. In this manner, the algorithm recognizes high-quality posts and shows them to even more Instagram users.</p><p> Coming up with the ways in which you can use the Instagram’s algorithm to your own advantage and discovering the best time to share a post on your account is not an exact science. However, there are certain general rules that apply to nearly all Instagrammers.</p><h3 id="The-general-rules-to-follow"><a href="#The-general-rules-to-follow" class="headerlink" title="The general rules to follow"></a>The general rules to follow</h3><ul><li><strong>Don’t forget about the time zones</strong></li></ul><p> This is a fairly simple rule that suggests that you should know your Instagram followers well enough to post for a time zone in which the majority of them lives. If your target market is in Asia or North America, then you should schedule posts for peak hours in their time zone, even if that means that you have to share posts in odd hours.</p><ul><li><strong>Share important posts on weekdays</strong></li></ul><p> Even though the differences in the engagement percentages of posts shared on weekends and weekdays are marginal, the statistics show that posts shared on Instagram on a Sunday drives less traffic than the one shared on a Wednesday or a Thursday.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t post during the working hours</strong></li></ul><p> We all lead busy lives and most of us don’t have the time for social media during the working hours. The period between 13:00h and 14:00h is a popular time for sharing posts on Instagram, but posting a photo or a video to this social media platform between 19:00 and 21:00 pm will produce the best results.</p><h3 id="Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals"><a href="#Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals"></a>Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals</h3><p> Finding the best time to reach your followers is going to take a certain amount of time until you finally come up with the best time to post on Instagram. Statistics can only partially help you in this endeavor since each account on Instagram is different and each company has different demographics, targets different markets and has different goals for their social media marketing campaigns.</p><p> Your own experience will tell you when the best time is to share a post on Instagram because you’ll be able to see when the posts that got the most attention were shared. Following the what the experts and their studies are saying blindly is not a good strategy because you can’ know how big the test group was or what were the findings of a study based on.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p> Define your target group, and learn as much as you can about the people you are trying to reach. Who are they? Where do they live? College students have very different lifestyles than the people working 9 to 5 jobs, so an Instagram account that offers sports gear to young people will naturally have different peak time than the account that sells office equipment. The more you learn about the habits of your Instagram followers the easier it gets to find the best day and time to post on your Instagram account.</p><p> Experimenting and trying to post on Instagram at different times, will show you when the best time is to share a post on your Instagram account. Once you find the peak hours for your Instagram account, you can use tools that enable you to schedule posts. However, sharing posts at the exactly the same time every day can be counterproductive, so in order to ensure the growth of your Instagram account, keep an open mind and try out new things from time to time.</p><h2 id="The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram"></a>The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</h2><p> Recently, Instagram has introduced the Schedule option that allows you to schedule posts in advance directly from the platform.

This photo and video sharing platform can help you reach new like-minded people, increase the sales of your products or simply share your favorite photos with the people you care about, but your Instagram posts won’t get the amount of attention they deserve if you don’t use the hidden tricks that can assist you in increasing the number of followers on your Instagram account.</p><p> Regardless of the reason why you are using Instagram, the tips featured in this article may provide assistance in mastering this platform and boosting the traffic on your account.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Money from Instagram - 2018 Ultimate Guide &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks"></a>Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks</h2><p> The key to success in life is consistency. The same can be said for Instagram since you can’t really expect to get thousands of likes on each post if you don’t add new content to your Instagram account consistently. Let’s explore Instagram’s hidden tips and tricks and see how you can enjoy even more success on this unique platform.</p><h3 id="1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches"><a href="#1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches" class="headerlink" title="1. Download videos and photos in batches"></a>1. Download videos and photos in batches</h3><p> Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://insta-downloader.net/" >Insta-downloader.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account. You just have to copy the URL of a photo or Instagram profile and click the Download button.</p><p> You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Instagram Video&#x2F;Photo Downloaders – Online &amp; Add-ons &amp; App Solutions &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Upload-photos-and-videos-from-your-computer"><a href="#2-Upload-photos-and-videos-from-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="2. Upload photos and videos from your computer"></a>2. Upload photos and videos from your computer</h3><p> The Instagram app can’t be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> You May Also Like:</p><h3 id="3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos"><a href="#3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Repost Instagram photos and videos"></a>3. Repost Instagram photos and videos</h3><p> There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn’t allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Repost app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.</p><h3 id="4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time"><a href="#4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time" class="headerlink" title="4. Post multiple photos at the same time"></a>4. Post multiple photos at the same time</h3><p> Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.</p><p> The ‘Select Multiple’ feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.</p><h3 id="5-Add-hashtags-after-posting"><a href="#5-Add-hashtags-after-posting" class="headerlink" title="5. Add hashtags after posting"></a>5. Add hashtags after posting</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram hashtags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are a powerful tool that can get your posts a lot of exposure and new followers, but they don’t work on other social media like Facebook or Twitter. That’s why you should post and share a photo or a video first, and then tap on the Edit button to add the hashtags you want to your Instagram post.</p><p> In this manner, you’ll be able to save a lot of time on deleting hashtags from the posts you shared on Facebook, Tumblr or any other social media platform.</p><h3 id="6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio"><a href="#6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio" class="headerlink" title="6. Add a URL to your bio"></a>6. Add a URL to your bio</h3><p> Featuring links to your blog or website in posts on Instagram or in comments is yet another thing you can’t do on this platform. However, if you want to direct traffic from your Instagram account to a website or a blog you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add a URL to your bio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The trick is to change the URL every time you start promoting a different project.</p><p> This tip can help you promote the products and services you’re offering on Instagram, and in addition, it can boost the conversion rates on your website, simply because more people will be able to see it.</p><h3 id="7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend"><a href="#7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend" class="headerlink" title="7. Send photos privately to a specific friend"></a>7. Send photos privately to a specific friend</h3><p> Tagging a friend in a post and having a public debate is not in accordance with everyone’s taste. Instagram however, provides the option to send a photo or a video to a friend privately. Having a private chat is a much better option if you had a more meaningful communication in mind than just exchanging a few emojis.</p><p> Furthermore, you can also send private messages to your Instagram followers by going to their profile and tapping on the Options icon that looks like three vertical black dots. Select the Send Message feature and enjoy chatting with your friends on Instagram.</p><h3 id="8-Use-Instagram-as-a-photo-editor"><a href="#8-Use-Instagram-as-a-photo-editor" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Instagram as a photo editor"></a>8. Use Instagram as a photo editor</h3><p> The photo editing features Instagram offers are truly magical, so if you need to edit a photo quickly you can use Instagram to do it. Enabling the Airplane mode will prevent the photo from being posted on your account, so before you start editing you should first switch to the Airplane mode, and make sure that the Instagram’s Save Original Photo option is activated.</p><p> Import the photo you’d like to edit to the Instagram app and apply filters or increase contrast or balance on your photo, and then proceed to share the picture. The app will report an error and inform you that the photo cannot be posted to your Instagram account, but the picture you edited will be saved in the photo gallery.</p><p> You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Best Instagram Photo Editors for 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="9-Schedule-posts-in-advance"><a href="#9-Schedule-posts-in-advance" class="headerlink" title="9. Schedule posts in advance"></a>9. Schedule posts in advance</h3><p> Social media campaigns depend on punctuality, which is the reason why scheduling Instagram posts is a strategy that might result in a better performance of your account. However, this Instagram tip works only if you have a Business profile on Instagram, and you’ll also have to get a social media scheduling tool and a HubSpot software.</p><p> The actual steps you’ll need to take in order to schedule a post depend on the social media scheduling tool you are using, so some additional research may be required before you can start scheduling your Instagram posts.</p><h3 id="10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post"><a href="#10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post" class="headerlink" title="10. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post"></a>10. Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post</h3><p> If you want to, you can get notifications for each post from your friends, business associates, and influencers. Turning on notifications on Instagram is easy since all you need to do is go to the Instagram user’s profile and select the ‘Turn on Post Notifications’ options from the Settings menu. The settings icon looks like three black dots, in case you are having trouble finding it.</p><p> However, if you would like this trick to work you must allow Instagram to send you notifications in the first place. Head over to your phone’s Settings menu, select the Apps option, locate the Instagram app and choose the feature that enables notifications.</p><h3 id="11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day"><a href="#11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day" class="headerlink" title="11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day"></a>11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day</h3><p> The ephemeral content is becoming more popular every day, but some Instagram Stories deserve more attention than they can get in a single day. If you would like your Instagram Stories to stay online for longer than 24 hours you can create Story Highlights.</p><p> Simply click on the + icon below the profile picture on your Instagram account and select the stories you want to feature in the Story Highlight from the album. The Story Highlights will be visible on your Instagram profile, for as long as you want. Removing or changing the Story Highlights is a simple process that won’t take more than five minutes of your time.</p><h3 id="12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts"><a href="#12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts" class="headerlink" title="12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts"></a>12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts</h3><p> A good Instagram account is coherent because Instagrammers interested in fashion have almost zero interest in sports, so if you want to post images that cover both of these topics it is best to create different accounts. Instagram lets its users manage up to 5 interconnected accounts, which opens a plethora of opportunities for big companies that offer more than just one service as well as for up and coming startups that are looking for a big breakthrough in a certain niche.</p><p> If you want to create a new Instagram account, go to Options and tap on the Add New Account feature. You can use the same username and password for all of your Instagram accounts.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Let us know in the comments which tricks and tips we didn’t mention in this article and share with us your favorite Instagram tricks.

While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn’t exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.</p><h2 id="8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram"><a href="#8-Best-Tools-for-Posting-Videos-From-Desktop-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram"></a>8 Best Tools for Posting Videos From Desktop to Instagram</h2><h4 id="1-Grum"><a href="#1-Grum" class="headerlink" title="1.

This platform is aimed at high-end professionals who can’t afford a second-rate service, which is why it also tells you how well your posts are performing on Instagram. Furthermore, their Agency package allows you to handle several Instagram accounts simultaneously.</p><p>People who choose to utilize Buffergram’s services can choose who many posts per day they want, so a post a day will cost you just $5 dollars a month while 5 daily posts cost $20 per month.

What’s more Onlypult stores your hashtags, which means that you can easily add hashtags you already used to new posts. During the scheduling process, you can upload as many photos and videos as you want and you can also apply filters, select the aspect ratio or add captions.</p><p>For $55 a month you can manage 40 Instagram accounts and post an unlimited number of posts to each of these accounts, which is the reason why Onlypult is the perfect tool for your Instagram marketing campaign.</p><h4 id="5-Gramblr"><a href="#5-Gramblr" class="headerlink" title="5.

Gramblr is available for both Mac and Windows OS and it offers more than 50 filters. In addition, you can add captions in any language, while you can also keep track of the basic analytics.</p><p>You can download Gramblr for free, but despite its advantages, this app lacks more advanced option that makes posting to Instagram much easier.</p><h4 id="6-Later"><a href="#6-Later" class="headerlink" title="6.

Even better; it’s free!</p><p>Snapseed comes with 26 built-in tools and filters, including popular options like lens blur, HDR Scape, and vintage filters. You can even remove people from your selfies and isolate individual items in your image for separate editing from the rest. It’s considered one of the best image editors for serious photographers, which can mean there’s a rather steep learning curve but a climb certainly worth making judging by the spectacular results.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express"><a href="#2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express" class="headerlink" title="2.

Free on iOS and Android, but with in-app purchases for the advanced features.</p><p>Expect to find all the usual tools such as crop, straighten and rotate, as well as tools to smooth, balance and remove red eye.

Although rather controversial, the editing available from this little app is truly out of this world, with nothing else in the market quite matching it for selfie tuning. It costs $3.99 to download, but there are no more purchases to make once you’ve bought the software.</p><p>From a standard portrait, you can add make up, reduce wrinkles, sweep highlight over your cheeks or make your eyelashes look fuller.

Here are five of the best Instagram photo editor options from the web.</p><h4 id="1-Canva"><a href="#1-Canva" class="headerlink" title="1. Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone.

Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap"><a href="#5-piZap" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Spark Post"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/" >Adobe Spark Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>From the photo geniuses (genii?) at Adobe comes this easy to use, fun and free photo editor, perfect for Instagram-worthy compositions.

It also gives live phone and chat support and the options for branded templates, and costs just $10 a month with no ongoing commitment.</p><p>Most of these online Instagram photo editors have been designed to work with all major browsers, including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge. However, if you’re having problems getting them to work on your PC or tablet, do try them in another browser as there have been some conflictions reported.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There you have our pick of the best Instagram photo editor apps and online services, many of which are completely free to use.

Highlights are featured below a user’s bio and appear in circles, with images and names that coincide with the content of the highlight.</p><p><em>Check this article to learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create an Instagram Story Highlight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></p><h2 id="How-Can-Story-Highlights-Help-Your-Business-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-Can-Story-Highlights-Help-Your-Business-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Can Story Highlights Help Your Business on Instagram?"></a>How Can Story Highlights Help Your Business on Instagram?</h2><p>While the Instagram Story is a fantastic way to share news, information and updates about your business, the information here is only viewable for 24 hours. For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner. The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically" class="headerlink" title="1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically"></a>1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account. Instagram celebrates the visual learners in all of us, use that to your advantage.</p><h3 id="2-Keep-it-Concise"><a href="#2-Keep-it-Concise" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it Concise"></a>2. Keep it Concise</h3><p>This feature allows you to upload up to 100 stories per Highlight. Wow! 100 stories!?</p><p>It seems great, that is until you remember how small of a window you have to capture a potential customer&#x2F;buyer. While some Highlight categories might call for more content, be sure to pick the most important, eye-catching and engaging stories to feature.</p><h3 id="3-Showcasing-Products-Services"><a href="#3-Showcasing-Products-Services" class="headerlink" title="3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services"></a>3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages. Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Company Announcements"></a>4. Make Company Announcements</h3><p>Having a Highlight to feature company&#x2F;business announcements is a great way for your audience to stay up to date with what you have going on.</p><p>Maybe your business is hiring, opening a new storefront, or featuring star employees. This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events"><a href="#5-Promote-Events" class="headerlink" title="5. Promote Events"></a>5. Promote Events</h3><p>Using Instagram to promote your event is a great way to build awareness and gauge interest from your audience.</p><p>Because the story feature only operates for 24 hours, having a Highlight for an upcoming event allows people to view the information for as long as you make it viewable. Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="6. Interact with your Audience"></a>6. Interact with your Audience</h3><p>Gain a better understanding of your customers by interacting with them in your stories. But don’t limit these interactions to 24 hours. By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature. This feature allows you to ask your audience questions and get their feedback in real time. Their responses will be sent directly to your Direct Message box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/interact-with-audience-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight interact with audience"                ></p><h3 id="7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ"><a href="#7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"></a>7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>Instead of leaving things up to the imagination, or having your audience sort through pages to find the answer to their question, creating an FAQ Highlight on your account can help your audience better understand important details about your business.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to include basic information in your FAQ highlight. You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><h3 id="8-How-To-Guides"><a href="#8-How-To-Guides" class="headerlink" title="8. How-To Guides"></a>8. How-To Guides</h3><p>If your product requires assembly or tips for use, consider creating a Highlight that shows customers how to use or build your product. Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials"></a>9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials</h3><p>Nothing helps the buyer’s decision more than seeing other happy customers. There is great value in showing love and support for your product, so don’t hesitate to highlight this in a Highlight. While tip #2 stated the importance of being concise, this is one highlight we recommend you make as long as possible. The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals" class="headerlink" title="10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals"></a>10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals</h3><p>The final tip we’d like to share is using Instagram Highlights to share any promotions or deals you are offering.</p><p>Boosting sales on Instagram is a great way to attract new business and followers.

This article covers an easy method to speed up the video on smartphones and computers and some online tools to assist you.

A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now.

In 2018, social media marketing and Instagram videos seem to be a match made in heaven, due to the platform’s rising popularity and better compatibility with the video content. Ads, Instagrams stories and regular posts on Instagram can all feature short video clips, that last just enough to convey the messages you want your followers to get.</p><p> Getting hundreds or thousands of views for your Instagram videos is not an easy task because you must invest a lot of time, effort and planning if you want your Instagram videos to get the attention they deserve. If you would like to increase the amount views your videos on Instagram are getting, you are at the right place because in this article we will provide you with some useful advice that might help you get more views on each video you post on your Instagram account.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong>  </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Money from Instagram - 2018 Ultimate Guide &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Increase Followers on Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-do-Instagram-video-views-work"><a href="#How-do-Instagram-video-views-work" class="headerlink" title="How do Instagram video views work?"></a>How do Instagram video views work?</h2><p> This metric isn’t too important for common Instagram users since most of the people on Instagram don’t use this social media network for professional purposes. Things change drastically if you are using Instagram to promote the services your company offers or to advertise brand’s products.</p><p> A video view is counted if the user of the platform has spent more than three seconds watching any given video. It is safe to say that your followers are going to have to spend a lot of time watching videos you post if you would like to reach the numbers of views videos are getting on other popular social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-get-more-Instagram-video-views"><a href="#How-to-get-more-Instagram-video-views" class="headerlink" title="How to get more Instagram video views?"></a>How to get more Instagram video views?</h2><h4 id="1-Pre-edit-videos-on-a-computer"><a href="#1-Pre-edit-videos-on-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="1.  Pre-edit videos on a computer"></a>1.  Pre-edit videos on a computer</h4><p> Android Smartphones and iPhones can capture high-res videos, but video editing apps still lack the features that video editing software like Wondershare Filmora provides. Pre-editing videos on a computer with Filmora will enable you to produce videos that have 1:1 aspect ratios, or to use some of the stunning visual effects provided by this amazing video editing software.</p><p> Furthermore, the videos edited on a computer will look more professional, because you can use it to add intros or create smooth transitions between the shots in your Instagram video.</p><h4 id="2-Post-the-behind-the-scenes-video"><a href="#2-Post-the-behind-the-scenes-video" class="headerlink" title="2.  Post the behind the scenes video"></a>2.  Post the behind the scenes video</h4><p> One of the greatest advantages the social media has brought to its users is the instant access to the events or projects that are organized by their favorite brands. Posting videos that show how the behind the scenes of a fashion show or a corporate event looks like will certainly attract a lot of attention from your Instagram followers.</p><p> If you would like to get more views for your Instagram videos, post behind the scenes videos on your Instagram account as often as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Choosing-the-appropriate-hashtags"><a href="#3-Choosing-the-appropriate-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="3.  Choosing the appropriate hashtags"></a>3.  Choosing the appropriate hashtags</h4><p> A hashtag is a powerful tool that shouldn’t be taken lightly because it is designed to extend the reach of your posts beyond your Instagram followers. Finding the best hashtags on Instagram is relatively easy since you only have to tap on the Search icon and you’ll be able to see posts with the trending hashtags on the platform.</p><p> A post with just a single hashtag has 12,6% more engagement than an Instagram post that doesn’t have any hashtags.</p><h4 id="4-Post-your-videos-at-peak-times"><a href="#4-Post-your-videos-at-peak-times" class="headerlink" title="4.  Post your videos at peak times"></a>4.  Post your videos at peak times</h4><p> In life and in social media marketing, timing is everything. Finding the best time to post your video on Instagram isn’t an exact science since different studies have come up with conflicting results. Despite this, the best time to post a video on Instagram is in the afternoon or in the evening when the majority of your followers are at home while posting during the working hours produces underwhelming results.</p><p> What’s more, brands that offer different services have different peak times, so you should use all the means available to you to find the best time to post a video on your Instagram account.</p><h4 id="5-Use-boomerangs-and-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#5-Use-boomerangs-and-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="5.  Use boomerangs and Instagram Stories"></a>5.  Use boomerangs and Instagram Stories</h4><p> Since the introduction of Instagram Stories in August 2016, the number of Instagram users has almost doubled, which only shows how popular and important Instagram Stories are. Even though videos featured in Instagram Stories cannot be longer than 15 seconds, they provide more than enough room to create compelling short videos.</p><p> Boomerang feature, is right at the border between a photo and a video which opens up space for experimentation and trying out different approaches to your followers.</p><h4 id="6-Include-a-call-to-action-in-the-comments-to-encourage-the-audience-interaction"><a href="#6-Include-a-call-to-action-in-the-comments-to-encourage-the-audience-interaction" class="headerlink" title="6.  Include a call to action in the comments to encourage the audience interaction"></a>6.  Include a call to action in the comments to encourage the audience interaction</h4><p> The importance of engaging the audience of your Instagram videos can hardly be stressed enough because even if your videos are worthy of an Oscar they won’t help your business grow if the audience doesn’t take action and buys the products you were showcasing on your Instagram account.</p><p> Including a call to action is the description of a video will spark enthusiasm and inspire the viewer of your Instagram video to post a comment, visit a website or take any other action you want them to.</p><h4 id="7-Repost-your-videos"><a href="#7-Repost-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="7.  Repost your videos"></a>7.  Repost your videos</h4><p> If your videos on Instagram are not getting as many views as you would like you can try reposting them because it can easily happen that some of the followers simply missed the video you posted.</p><p> Producing and posting fresh content on your Instagram account is important, but every once in a while you should take the time to remind your followers of the great things you’ve already done. Furthermore, every few months you’ll have new followers so reposting a video can be a great way to show them a video they might have missed.</p><h4 id="8-Run-Instagram-video-ads"><a href="#8-Run-Instagram-video-ads" class="headerlink" title="8.  Run Instagram video ads"></a>8.  Run Instagram video ads</h4><p> Switching to an Instagram business profile will enable you to invest money in video ads that can extend the reach of your posts. If your videos don’t get enough views paying for an advertisement might do the trick and produce the traffic on your Instagram page you were hoping for.</p><p> Video ads can be used you to target a particular demographics which can be quite useful if you are trying to reach a new market that could actually need your products or services.</p><h4 id="9-Link-your-Instagram-account-to-other-social-media-or-your-website"><a href="#9-Link-your-Instagram-account-to-other-social-media-or-your-website" class="headerlink" title="9.  Link your Instagram account to other social media or your website"></a>9.  Link your Instagram account to other social media or your website</h4><p> Your Facebook friends may not even know that you have an Instagram account, so instead of constantly trying to reach new followers, dig into your base of already existing contacts. Linking your Instagram account to other social media accounts or even your website can generate new followers.</p><p> The best part is, that you’ll probably increase the number of views your Instagram videos are getting just by letting your friends on social media that you have an account on Instagram.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p> Cheating is not really an option if you really want to increase the number of views your Instagram videos are getting, although you can actually buy fake Instagram video views. Organic content has proven to deliver better results in practice, and besides, you are risking being labeled a fraud. Each of the strategies we explored in this article will assist you in attracting more attention to your videos, but you should be patient and post high-quality content consistently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-instagram-success-starts-with-these-strategies/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Instagram Success Starts with These Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exclusive-ig-edits-for-apple-and-android-users/"><u>2024 Approved  Exclusive IG Edits for Apple & Android Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-instagram-innovations-enhancers-that-excite-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Instagram Innovations  Enhancers that Excite for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/the-social-media-analysts-toolkit-making-sense-of-instagram-stats-for-2024/"><u>The Social Media Analyst's Toolkit  Making Sense of Instagram Stats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pictureprofessional-expert-guide-to-adjusting-ig-content-sizes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  PictureProfessional  Expert Guide to Adjusting IG Content Sizes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-uncovering-niche-experts-on-instagram-a-guide-to-impactful-collaborators/"><u>[New] Uncovering Niche Experts on Instagram  A Guide to Impactful Collaborators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-rewind-and-play-instagrams-backwards-videos-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Rewind and Play  Instagram's Backwards Videos Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-clickbait-whats-real-about-instagram-reels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beyond Clickbait  What's Real About Instagram Reels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-stardews-best-modifications-a-list-of-the-top-7/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring Stardew's Best Modifications  A List of the Top 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-a-sim-network-unlock-pin-get-your-sony-xperia-1-v-phone-network-ready-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, What Is a SIM Network Unlock PIN?
