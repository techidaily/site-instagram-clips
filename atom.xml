The only solution to this issue is to crop the video and change its aspect ratio so it fits one of the commonly used aspect ratios on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download Filmora and Import the file into the software</strong></p><p>In order to start cropping your videos, you first must install the Filmora video editing software on your computer. Open the video editor in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, and then click on the Import drop-down menu and select the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Drag and Drop the video file onto the Timeline</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Now that the video clip you want to edit is in the editor’s media library, drag it and drop it to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop videos for Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>1. Landscape (16:9)</strong></p><p>Chances are that the camera you used to record your video clip recorded the footage in the landscape aspect ratio. Before you can export your video clip, you must first check the resolution and frame rate of the clip you want to export. Right-click on the clip in the media panel and select Properties. After you found out this information, click on the Export button located just below the media panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="check aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Once the new window appears, you should click on the Format icon positioned in the upper left corner of the screen. Select the MP4 format, name your file and select the folder where the file will be exported.</p><p>Click on the Settings button and then set the Quality of the video to Best and select the HD Optimized option in the Encoder menu. Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio. Once you made the calculations return to Filmora and click on the Manually option in the Crop and Pan screen. Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-short-lived-vid-impression/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Short-Lived Vid Impression</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-speech-logging-for-mac-our-top-5-list-unveiled/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ultimate Speech Logging for Mac Our Top 5 List Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-bridging-communication-gaps-utilizing-zoom-with-gmail-mail/"><u>[New] Bridging Communication Gaps Utilizing Zoom with Gmail Mail</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-stealthy-methods-to-watch-unseen-stories/"><u>[New] Stealthy Methods to Watch Unseen Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-instagram-content-free-mp4-exporters-for-windowsmac-users/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Instagram Content Free MP4 Exporters for Windows/Mac Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-rhythm-and-reels-instagram-music-secrets/"><u>[Updated] Rhythm & Reels Instagram Music Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-photo-perfection-discover-our-6-best-background-erasers/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Photo Perfection – Discover Our 6 Best Background Erasers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/five-innovative-text-riddles-for-group-fun-time/"><u>Five Innovative Text Riddles for Group Fun Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-xiaomi-14-pro-lock-screen-password-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Xiaomi 14 Pro Lock Screen Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-smart-video-alteration-for-mac-users-seeking-insta-perfect-posts/"><u>In 2024, Smart Video Alteration for Mac Users Seeking Insta-Perfect Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-guide-changing-voices-in-instagram-features/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide Changing Voices in Instagram Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-realme-c67-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Realme C67 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-forum.techidaily.com/unleashing-your-brands-potential-on-major-platforms-facebook-twitter-instagram-and-youtube-explained/"><u>Unleashing Your Brand's Potential on Major Platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube Explained</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144284/7443" target="_top" id="2144284">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144284" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144284/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

As you would tap on the “Music” option, it will automatically suggest numerous songs that are trending. If you want, you can tap on the search bar and enter keywords for songs, artists, albums, etc. to look for anything specific.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-taylor-swift-songs.jpg"                      alt=" Select Taylor Swift Songs"                ></p><p>Once you find the song of your choice, just tap on it and it will be loaded on the Instagram Story interface.

There’s no need to worry about photo sizes or aspect ratios because Instagram is going to the all the heavy work for you.</p><p>Troubles begin when you want to upload photos and videos that weren’t captured with a Smartphone to Instagram. In most cases, the photos and videos produced by DSLR cameras and other semi-professional and professional equipment are much larger than the sizes supported by Instagram. That is the reason why we created this guide that will help you post visual content that is perfectly adjusted to Instagram in 2021.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram"><a href="#Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Types of Files Accepted by Instagram"></a>Types of Files Accepted by Instagram</h2><p>The first thing you need to pay attention to when uploading images and videos to Instagram is that the files you are uploading are in one of the photo or video formats that Instagram supports.</p><p><strong>Photo File Types</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Instagram supports only two file formats. You should make sure that your photo is either saved in <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> file format because all other file formats won’t do the trick, and you’ll be forced to go back to the photo editor you used and change the file format before you can upload a photo to Instagram. Posting GIF files is not possible without apps such as GIPHY CAM or GifLab because this type of files isn’t supported by Instagram.</p><p><strong>Video File Types</strong></p><p>Things get much easier when it comes to video since Instagram supports nearly all video file formats you can think of. However, the most commonly used types of video files uploaded to Instagram are have an  codec and a MP.4 file extension, which is the reason why we recommend converting your video files into this file format before uploading them to Instagram.</p><p>Duration of Videos on Instagram</p><p>You can either upload a video to Instagram’s main feed or you can upload it as a story. If you decide to upload a video to the main feed, the time limit is set at just 60 seconds, while the length of a video in an Instagram story cannot exceed 15 seconds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts"><a href="#Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts"></a>Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts</h2><p>A couple of years ago, Instagram has finally allowed its users to upload images that aren’t square shaped.

No doubt, one of the most popular social platforms around the world is Instagram, with the exciting option - IG Story. With this feature, posted photos and short videos disappear after 24 hours. The only thing you can do to save them on your account is to add them to Highlights. Since Instagram doesn’t support making cover itself on the app, you need a dedicated third-party tool to do it.

It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music.

Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137219/26400" target="_top" id="2137219">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137219" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137219/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.</p><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short.

Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982570">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982570.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982570">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982570.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982570%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982570/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.
