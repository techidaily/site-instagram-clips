## Part 4: How to Add Filters on Instagram Reels?

Instagram Reels are very similar to TikTok videos, with the iconic feature of uploading entertaining short fifteen-second videos as Instagram Reels. Instagram reels are one of the most prominent features of the new updated version of the Instagram Application.

This method is quite similar to that of applying filters to Instagram stories. For your ease, we have listed a step-by-step guide below to add filters on Instagram reels.

**Step 1: Go to Create Mode**

Tap on the camera icon on the top left corner of the screen. And then, tap on the Reels option to go to Instagram reels create mode.

**Note:** Another way to create an Instagram Reel is to go to the reels explore page and tap on the camera icon present at the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 2: Tap on the Smiley Face Icon**

Next, tap on the **Smiley Face Icon** to add filters. Choose from the variety of available filters. Then tap on the chosen filter to apply it to your Instagram reel.

**Step 3: Start Recording**

Once you are done selecting the desired filter for your Instagram reel, start recording. After the recording is done, you will notice the filter added to the whole Instagram reel you just shot.

## Part 5: How to Organize the Instagram Filters for Post/Reels/Feed?

Instagram is a great application that offers a wide range of filters to its users. Even though it's a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.

The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post/Reels/Feed.

**Step 1: Tap on Manage Option**

The initial step is to select or capture a photo/video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the **Manage** option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.

**Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters**

For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.

**Note:** Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the **Drag to hide** option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.

**Step 3: Tap Done**

Once you have made the required adjustments, tap on the **Done** option present at the top right corner of the screen. And you are done rearranging the filters!

**Conclusion**

For many individuals, using Instagram might not be as easy as it is for the new generation. It could be because some individuals find the layout to be a bit complicated, which might be the reason why they are not able to apply filters.

But don't panic! In this article, we have talked about the nitty-gritty on **how to use filters on Insta**. And that's about it on how to use filters on Instagram.

Even though keeping the application updated is crucial, it is also essential to follow each step thoroughly to add filters to your Instagram Post/Feed/Story effortlessly. You won't face any issue if you follow the steps exactly as mentioned.
