## Part 1: How to Add Instagram Filters to Existing Photos?

We all take random photos all the time through our cameras. But, you can be doubtful about posting them on Instagram because they look raw.

It not only makes the picture appear more attractive but also catches the audience's attention. In this section, you will learn how to apply an Instagram filter to any photo from your gallery.

**Step 1: Open Instagram and swipe left**
