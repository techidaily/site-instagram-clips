The music that is being played will be added to the Reel.

## Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?

## Part 7: How to Add Music to Instagram Reels Business Account?

Adding music to a regular Instagram Reels account is easy. You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction.
