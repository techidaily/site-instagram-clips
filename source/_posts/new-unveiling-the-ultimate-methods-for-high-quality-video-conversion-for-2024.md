## Method 1—Convert Instagram Video to MP4 Using an Online Converter

What is an online Instagram to MP4 converter? Let's take a quick look!

InstagramSave, as the name itself suggests, is a free, yes you read it right, 100% free converter. It is available worldwide and requires no installation. All you need is an internet connection, and you're good to go. Are you excited yet? But hold your horses, because these aren't the only perks that InstagramSave offers. Apart from being hassle-free and easy to access, it provides a few more benefits:

* Download high-quality videos in their original resolution
* Only an Instagram video's URL is needed
* Save a video from any Instagram page like home feed, status, or explore page
* Available on iPhone, Android as well as on PC
