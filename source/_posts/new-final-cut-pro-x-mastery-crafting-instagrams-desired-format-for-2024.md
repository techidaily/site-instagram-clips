Here is another bonus section regarding tips on vertical videos for Instagram in addition to the video specs. Read through them as we have covered how to make vertical videos stunning for Instagram.

**Tip 1: Be specific to vertical**

Why get worked up by shooting the video in Landscape and cropping them? To make it a hassle-free task so that you can share the video on multiple platforms like Facebook and YouTube, you can turn your camera upright on your smartphone and shoot the vertical footage for the best results. Doing so will let you complete control over the screen to fill the whole frame for a better viewing experience. If on camera, you can rotate it to 90 degrees.

**Tip 2: Post-produce edit from horizontal to vertical**

Is the video already shot horizontally on your camera or smartphone? No worries, as you can edit them to the desired aspect ratio from 16:9 to 9:16 with the assistance of software like iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, and other third-party applications like [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This tactic's only challenge is that you need to be ready to crop the left and right sides of the shot or recorded video, and do not forget that the concept needs to be centralized!

**Tip 3: Crop to reveal details**

Vertical video is a great option to showcase wide and tall subjects where you can place close-ups and show off details to get up close and personal. It could be a product or fabric. You can showcase enticing minor elements that attract an audience in such landscape shots.

## Conclusion

Hence, I am sure you found new tactics to create vertical videos for Instagram. Therefore, put them into practice the next time you make your vertical video for a story or IGTV. Is your video shot or recorded horizontal by mistake? No more worry, as you can edit vertical video for Instagram in the Final Cut Pro.
