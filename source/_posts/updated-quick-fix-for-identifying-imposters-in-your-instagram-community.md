### 3\. Check Engagement

 The [engagement rate](https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/) must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account. The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.

 The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10\. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.

### 4\. Using Third-Party Tools

 If you feel that calculating manually is not the best thing to do, you can also find some tools that can help you to determine if the followers of your influencer are fake.

#### [FollowerCheck](https://www.fakecheck.co/)

 FollowerCheck is one such tool that scans the influencer’s profile and finds out the results for real versus the fake followers. The most suspicious follower’s names are identified through this tool. It is a free tool that helps you with snapshots of the followers of the account. If a valid account has several fake Instagram followers, then you may block or remove the users. FollowerCheck offers 100% accurate results and works for the large follower bases.

### 3\. Check Engagement

 The [engagement rate](https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/) must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account.

 The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers.

Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10\. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.
