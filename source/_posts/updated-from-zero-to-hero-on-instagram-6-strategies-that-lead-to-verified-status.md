## Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?

 Checking the [help files](https://help.instagram.com/398038890351915) can give you the clear picture of the verification process of Instagram account.

 The Instagram verified badge is the confirmation of the account being an authentic one. Whether a global brand, public figure or celebrity, a badge represents the genuineness of the account.

 As the celebs and brands are the most followed ones and people would always like to find them instantanuously, Instagram ensures the community faces no issues while searching the right account of their most followed brands or celebs.

 Instagram makes it very clear to the users that although Facebook owns Instagram, the two networking sites are not related to each other when it comes to followers or verifying the Instagram account.

 According to Instagram policies, if you have several followers or if one can find you easily doesn’t qualify you for the Instagram blue tick. Only the accounts that are being copied or have high chances of being imitated or impersonated are the ones with the verified badges.
