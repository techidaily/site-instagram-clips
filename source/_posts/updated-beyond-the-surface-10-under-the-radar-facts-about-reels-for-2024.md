## 10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels

Instagramreels are short 15-second multi-clip videos with audio, effects, and other exciting editing tools. This section will let you know all about Instagram Reels, where Facebook launched it first, how huge it has become, how similar it is to TikTok, and much more.

### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands. During the lockdown, people all over the world have taken over TikTok to get rid of their boredom. Instagram Reels is practically the same thing as TikTok. The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.

Instagram launched the Reels update for a trail run in Brazil in November 2019\. It allowed Reels to be shared on Stories or via DMs. It is called Cenas in Brazil and is part of the Instagram Stories instead of a separate application.

### #3\. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month

Instagram is a worldwide platform that reaches over a billion users every month. This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease. Introducing the Reels feature will surely increase the number of users as it will attract users of TikTok as well.

### #10\. Can Instagram Reels replace TikTok?

Instagram Reels has been successful, but the big question is that can it replace TikTok? Well, since its launch, it has caught the attention of many TikTok users, but it still has a long way to go before it can completely replace TikTok. Currently, TikTok is relatively better as it provides more options and space to grow as compared to the Reels.
