## Part 4: How to Add Your Own Background Music to Reels?

In case you don't want to use any of the songs from Reel's music section, instead use something of your own; you can do that too! All you will have to do is use any of the music apps on your phone with your Instagram account. Then, play your favorite song, and while doing that, start recording a reel. The music that is being played will be added to the Reel.

## Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?

If you don't want to add music as your background sound, instead use your voice as a voiceover; Instagram has the voiceover feature that will let you do that. However, you can apply this feature only after finishing your recording.

**Step 1:** Open your Instagram account and click on your profile to start recording for your Reel. And then record the video as usual for the Reel.

**Step 2:** If you want to add music, you can do that; if not, just let it be. After the recording is done, you will be taken to another page. Here, you will see some option right at the top of the recorded video. Click on the Microphone icon.

![instagram reels microphone option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-microphone-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, start recording your voice. Once you are done recording your voice, click on the Done option.

## Part 6: How to Save Reels with Music?

Although the Reels stay there on your profile in the Reels section, they don't get saved on your mobile automatically. So, if you want to know **how to save reels with music** on your device, here are the steps you need to follow:

**Step 1:** Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture. When the page appears where you can add a Post, Story, or Reel, you need to click on the top left gear icon, which is the Camera Settings icon.

## Part 7: How to Add Music to Instagram Reels Business Account?

Adding music to a regular Instagram Reels account is easy. You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction.

The key is to search for a song with the words "Original Music."
