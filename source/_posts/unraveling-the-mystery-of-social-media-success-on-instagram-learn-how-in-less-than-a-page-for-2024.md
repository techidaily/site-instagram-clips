## Part 3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram?

### 1\. Build Followers And Increase Engagement

On the contrary, if you have lesser followers and more clones to your account, Instagram consider it as high priority account for verification and the Instagram blue tick follows. Huge followers are not everything when it comes to verifying the Instagram account.
