If you are using iPhone, you may find that when you took Live Photos, there was a Loop effect under it. In this part, I will show you how to upload the looping live photos to Instagram.

 **Step 1: Add Bounce or Loop Effect to Live Photos**

Go to Photos app on iPhone and open the live photo. Swipe up and you will four options: live, loop, and bounce, and long exposure.
