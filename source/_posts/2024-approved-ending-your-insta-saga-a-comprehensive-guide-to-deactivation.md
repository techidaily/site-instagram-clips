Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms around the world with about [1 million](https://backlinko.com/instagram-users) active users every month and a total of 1.074 billion users in 2021\. Most people don’t realize time flying while using Instagram and it can become very addictive.

This problem is sorted out by deactivating or deleting the Instagram account. The difference between deleting an Instagram account and deactivating an Instagram account is that while deleting is permanent, deactivating is temporary.

Let’s have a look at how both these actions can be performed in case you feel like Instagram is impacting your life more than it’s needed.

## Part 1: How to Delete an Instagram Account Permanently

## Part 2: How to Deactivate an Instagram Account Temporarily

In case you have a very interesting Instagram account with a lot of followers and posts, and you wish to take a break from Instagram, then deactivating Instagram would be the best option.
