There is [some discussion](https://www.quora.com/How-many-hashtags-are-too-many-on-instagram) as to how many hashtags are too many, and while there isn’t a hard and fast rule, there are some considerations that you need to make. Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.

Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.
