## Part 3: How to Upload Looping Live Photos as Videos on iPhone to Instagram?

If you are using iPhone, you may find that when you took Live Photos, there was a Loop effect under it. In this part, I will show you how to upload the looping live photos to Instagram.

 **Step 1: Add Bounce or Loop Effect to Live Photos**

Go to Photos app on iPhone and open the live photo. Swipe up and you will four options: live, loop, and bounce, and long exposure. To make a live looping photo, click on the loop option, which can turn the live photo to a video loop directly; or you can choose Bounce effect, which will make the live photo rock back and forth.

 **Step 2: Save Looping Live Photo into A Video**

If you sharing the live photo applied Loop or Bounce effect to social media directly, you will find the animation is lost. So, before sharing, we need to save the looping live photo to video first.
