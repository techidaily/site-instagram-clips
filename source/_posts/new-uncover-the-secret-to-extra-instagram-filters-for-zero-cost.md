## Part 2: How to Search New Filters on Instagram from Creators' Profile

Even though official Instagram allows the creators to make their filters and then upload them on Instagram, you can use Instagram's filters and the filters created by others. The method discussed above is quite time-consuming, but searching a filter through the creator's profile can help us achieve the same goal and save time.

This way, you can also get to know about the creators who make good Instagram filters. You can follow the following steps to understand how to find Instagram filters through the creator's profile:

### Step 1: Find Creator's Profile

![Find Instagram Filter - search creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-creator-profile.jpg)

Launch the Instagram app on your phone. Then go to the search engine by clicking on the **search icon** at the bottom of your screen. Now search the creator's profile by typing their username.
