## How to Add Highlights to Instagram Profile?

Once you have created a highlight, that highlight will appear on your profile. If you have not created a highlight yet, you will need to create your first highlight from a story for you to see anything on your profile.

If a highlight does not show up on your profile, check that you have a unique name for the highlight and that you have followed all of the steps needed to create the graphic, naming, and story selections properly.

Generally, stories disappear after 24 hours if they are just posted to your profile.

Highlights which appear on your profile under your bio are the best way in which to share stories and otherwise archived content with your viewers.
