 You need to be very popular in order to get your account verified by Instagram to avail this opportunity. It's a big thing to get that, unless you are a public figure. Alternatively, you can just have a text overlay that displays your URL, though, it is not clickable. Future updates might support sharing links on Instagram Stories for all.

**Step 1** – Take a shot or record a video using the Instagram Stories camera or select a recently (within 24 hours) clicked photo by swiping the screen up.

**Step 2** – Now, tap the chain icon from the top right corner of the screen and enter the desired URL. Select the tick mark on the top right corner of the Instagram Story window.

**Step 3** – Once the URL is incorporated, enjoy editing your Story with filters, stickers, text and then tap 'Next'. It is important to add a call to action here. So, you can mention 'Swipe up to know more', 'See more', 'Explore' etc. to guide the users.

**Step 4** \- Browse any picture in your profile and click the blue color 'Promotion' button to get diverted to 'Facebook'. Add a link there and checkout with payment.

### Section 3: Add a link in bio

In this case, when you post a new picture, you need to mention 'Link in bio' under the description section, so that the audience comes to the main page of your profile and visit the clickable link found there.

It's important to give the CTA – call to action, no matter which way you post your link in Instagram.

 Here are the steps to do this –
