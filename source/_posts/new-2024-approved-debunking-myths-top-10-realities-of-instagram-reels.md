**Q: How can I upload Reels on Instagram?**

**A:** After you are satisfied with your Reel, all you have to do is tap on the ">" icon. On the Share page, you have the choose a cover and write a caption before sharing it. You can share the reels on the Explore page and your Reels tab as well as your Feed. Switch the toggle off if you don’t want to share it with your Feed. Tap Share to upload the Reel. You can also save it as a draft if you do not wish to upload it immediately.

#### Final Thoughts

Instagram Reels are a fun and exciting new feature. It will indeed prove to be a massive success for Facebook as brands and content creators make and create Reels to promote and sell their stuff. But aside from that, it is an excellent addition to your Insta life! You can enjoy it with your friends or by yourself and use different effects and audios to make aesthetically pleasing clips! Happy Reeling!
