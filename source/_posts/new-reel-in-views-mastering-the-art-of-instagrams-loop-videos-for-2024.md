#### 2.Add on the Loop

Boomerangs are perfect when you add on a loop. This includes a forward movement, followed by a backward movement, and then forward again.

Boomerangs are perfect when you add on a loop. This includes a forward movement, followed by a backward movement, and then forward again.
