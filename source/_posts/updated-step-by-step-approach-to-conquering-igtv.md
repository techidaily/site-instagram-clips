## Part 3: Tips for promoting IGTV

 You can promote IGTV with ease, after knowing what IGTV is, and how to use it. Here are some prominent tips to help you in this regard. Keep exploring!

### 1\. Vertical Video is necessary

 For Instagram TV (IGTV), it is important to have vertical videos. The old YouTube horizontal videos need you to rotate your screen to watch them properly. Fix the 1080X1920 pixels dimensions as that of Instagram Stories for IGTV videos. You can alternatively stick to the 9.16 aspect ratio for these IGTV vertical videos.

### 2\. Keep It Short

 Just because you have got a video limit of 10 minutes doesn’t mean you will pester the channel with anything and everything without bothering about the video length. Always keeping it short works, as people rarely stay interested beyond the initial 3-4 minutes of a video. Unless you belong to the film industry and have HD quality videos with breathtaking content don’t rush to post 30-40 minutes long ones. Anything between 2 to 5 minutes is worth.

### 3\. Don’t Just Repost videos

 Unlike Instagram Stories, IGTV content is going to stay there beyond the 24 hours. So, wisely choose content for your channel and keep your followers intact.

## Conclusion

 We are optimistic that this article has brought everything that you wanted to know about IGTV. Be it what is IGTV or how does IGTV work. Our elaborate guide on how to use IGTV has certainly made your task easier. Enjoy your new IGTV channel!
