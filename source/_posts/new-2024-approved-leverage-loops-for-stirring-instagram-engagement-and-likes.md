Looping a particular scene adds a lot of excitement to the video, and it has become a significant element of the Instagram experience. For those who don’t want to download and install any software program on your computer, we recommend you to use some online tools to loop video.

### 2. Kapwing

Kapwing is a free online tool which allows you to loop, clip, and trim the video to make them a lot more interesting. The only downside of this tool is that it only lets you loop the video a maximum of 10 times. Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to loop videos using Kapwing.

 **Step 1:** Visit the Loop Video in Kapwing on your browser, and then upload your video by clicking on the "Upload" button, or you can also upload the video by pasting its URL link.

Boomerang is a video app which allows you to record looping videos like animated gif. In the following part, I will show you 2 different ways to making looping video with Boomerang.

## Part 3: How to Upload Looping Live Photos as Videos on iPhone to Instagram?

If you are using iPhone, you may find that when you took Live Photos, there was a Loop effect under it. In this part, I will show you how to upload the looping live photos to Instagram.

 **Step 1: Add Bounce or Loop Effect to Live Photos**

Go to Photos app on iPhone and open the live photo. Swipe up and you will four options: live, loop, and bounce, and long exposure. To make a live looping photo, click on the loop option, which can turn the live photo to a video loop directly; or you can choose Bounce effect, which will make the live photo rock back and forth.

![convert live photo to looping video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-loop-bounce-effect-to-live-photos.jpg)

 **Step 2: Save Looping Live Photo into A Video**

If you sharing the live photo applied Loop or Bounce effect to social media directly, you will find the animation is lost. So, before sharing, we need to save the looping live photo to video first.
