## Part 1: How to Add Instagram Filters to Existing Photos?

We all take random photos all the time through our cameras. But, you can be doubtful about posting them on Instagram because they look raw. Some people think they can only apply filters when taking photos directly from Instagram. However, this is not the case because you can apply an Instagram filter to existing images also. It not only makes the picture appear more attractive but also catches the audience's attention. In this section, you will learn how to apply an Instagram filter to any photo from your gallery.

**Step 1: Open Instagram and swipe left**

To add Instagram filters, you have to open Instagram and log in to your existing ID. When you are on your news feed, you have to **swipe left** to open the stories option. When you swipe left, your camera will open automatically. Another way to open the stories option is to **tap on the '+' sign** on your profile picture.
