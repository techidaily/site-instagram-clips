Recording handheld high-resolution videos with iPhones and Android Smartphones has been made possible by the rapid advancement of technology. Recording audio, however, is an entirely different matter, because microphones on Smartphone devices often pick up atmospheric noises that completely ruin the audio of a video clip.

Only a couple of years ago, editing the audio of a video clip captured with a Smartphone would require you to transfer the video clip to a computer and then use a video editing software to add music to the video, but in 2018, you can easily add music to the videos you want to post on Instagram by using apps for Android and iPhone devices.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.
