First of all, you need to select a niche you are extremely passionate about. It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.

On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over.

Rather than posting random things, figure out what can go in combo and curate your content. For example, you love fashion and good at DIY. Then you can show how to make DIY clothing, accessories, recycle things, etc. and retain your posts’ originality.
