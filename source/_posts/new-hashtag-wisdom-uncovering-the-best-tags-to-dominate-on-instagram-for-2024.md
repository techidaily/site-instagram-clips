There is [some discussion](https://www.quora.com/How-many-hashtags-are-too-many-on-instagram) as to how many hashtags are too many, and while there isn’t a hard and fast rule, there are some considerations that you need to make. Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.

Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.

Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.
