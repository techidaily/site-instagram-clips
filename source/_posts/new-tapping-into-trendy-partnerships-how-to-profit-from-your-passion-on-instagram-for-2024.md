### 6\. Don't forget to affiliate

Instagram sponsorship for small accounts is obviously going to help you move ahead. Along with that make sure to affiliate with others for enhancing the sales of your brand’s products or services.

An affiliate is basically focused at improving the sales of brands partnering with them for a commission. Whereas influencers are basically involved with creating brand awareness. There is a trackable link or certain promo code that followers can click for actually buying your service/product.

As links in Instagram are allowed only in the bio, you have to consider one product at once for applying affiliate links. Creating promo codes is a better substitute to entwine them with your posts. Though, Instagram is allowing links in Instagram Stories now.

Here are some popular affiliate platforms with online merchants that you can explore – ClickBank, RewardStyle, and Amazon’s Affiliate Program are a few of them. Use other marketing channels and your website to strengthen the affiliate program.
