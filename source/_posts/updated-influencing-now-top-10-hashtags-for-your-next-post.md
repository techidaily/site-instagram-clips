## How To Select the Right HashTags for Your Podcast

If you're interested in building a successful podcast, you've got to get the correct hashtags. So today, we'll walk through the steps to finding the perfect hashtags for your podcast.

### Combination of broad and niche

All you need to do is niche down the leading podcast into the type of podcast you create. It must include the topic, industry, theme, background & idea for your podcast. Thus it will be unique to your brand. The more specific you get, the better.

### Combination of short & long

It would be best if you used short and long hashtags together to match the context of your podcast. For example, your podcast is on fitness. Your short hashtags will cover general topics like; health and healthy life. While longer hashtags would be more precise. For example: the right diet plan, workout routine plan, exercises, etc.
