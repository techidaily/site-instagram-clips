The process of uploading a video to IGTV isn’t much more complicated than posting a photo or video to your Instagram account and it can be completed in just a couple of quick taps. Naturally, in order to be able to use IGTV, you must have an Instagram account, so before you take any other steps, make sure that you are signed in to your account on Instagram.

#### Creating an IGTV Channel

Launch the Instagram app, and then tap on the **Settings icon** located in the upper right corner. Pick the **Create Channel** option and that is it, you will now be able to add videos to your IGTV channel or browse and watch videos other creators post on their channels.

#### Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app

It doesn’t really matter which of these two apps you decide to use to upload videos to your IGTV channel, because the process is identical. Simply tap on the **IGTV icon** that looks like, well, a TV with an antenna and then tap on the **\+ icon** to add a video from your camera roll. Keep in mind that videos that last more than a couple of minutes can be huge in size and that it might be better to upload videos to your IGTV channel from a computer if the video is larger than one or two gigabytes.

Write a description of the video and give it a catchy title before hitting the **Post button**. Optionally, you can **enable the share to Facebook option** even before you post the video to your IGTV channel, but you can also share a video to different social media platforms after you posted it to IGTV.

#### Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer

Click on the icon located next to the heart-shaped icon that displays all the notifications, located in the top right corner, in order to gain access to your Instagram channel.

Proceed to click on the **IGTV icon**, and then click on the **Upload button**. Once a new page loads you can **upload a cover photo** or add a **description and a title**. On the left side of the screen you will be able to see a **\+ icon** and below it, you’ll see the **Drag and Drop a Video File** message.

## Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV

Despite the fact that you can now upload videos that last for an entire hour, it is still better to keep the content you share on your IGTV channel short. Videos that **last between two and five minutes** are best suited for the audience on social media. Posting videos that surpass the five-minute limit can prove to be counterproductive because people won’t take the time to watch them from start to finish.

Aside from YouTube, a majority of videos on social media platforms are watched without sound. That’s why adding subtitles to your video may be a good idea, but just remember that you have to hardcode the subtitles into the video since SRT files don’t work well with vertical videos.

## Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV

Despite the fact that you can now upload videos that last for an entire hour, it is still better to keep the content you share on your IGTV channel short. Videos that **last between two and five minutes** are best suited for the audience on social media. Posting videos that surpass the five-minute limit can prove to be counterproductive because people won’t take the time to watch them from start to finish.

Aside from YouTube, a majority of videos on social media platforms are watched without sound. That’s why adding subtitles to your video may be a good idea, but just remember that you have to hardcode the subtitles into the video since SRT files don’t work well with vertical videos.

## Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel

After uploading a video to IGTV you can monitor the number of **likes, comments, and views** by tapping on the **‘three dots’ icon** located next to the **Like, Comment and Share icons** on a particular video. A **drop-down menu will appear** on the screen and you should tap on the **View Insights** option in order to see how many **views, likes and comments** your video got. Below the **Engagement information**, you can find the **Audience Retention** menu that offers **Average Percentage Watch** information as well as **a drop-off graph** that tells you at which point viewers stop watching your video. The data provided by the IGTV analytics can be extremely valuable when planning future posts on IGTV. Moreover, you can use conventional tools for content promotion on Instagram to increase the number of views your IGTV videos are getting.

**Conclusion**

In the first six months after its initial launch IGTV seems like it has made Instagram more entertaining because it encourages creators to post captivating videos people around the globe love watching. Hopefully, we have provided you with all the information you’re going to need to upload your first video to IGTV. Leave a comment below and share your IGTV experiences with us.
