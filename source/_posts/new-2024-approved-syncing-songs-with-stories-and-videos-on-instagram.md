Recording handheld high-resolution videos with iPhones and Android Smartphones has been made possible by the rapid advancement of technology. Recording audio, however, is an entirely different matter, because microphones on Smartphone devices often pick up atmospheric noises that completely ruin the audio of a video clip.

Only a couple of years ago, editing the audio of a video clip captured with a Smartphone would require you to transfer the video clip to a computer and then use a video editing software to add music to the video, but in 2018, you can easily add music to the videos you want to post on Instagram by using apps for Android and iPhone devices. If you were looking for an easy way to add music to video clips you've captured with a Smartphone, you've come to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can add music to Instagram videos and stories in just a few simple steps.

## How to Add Music to Instagram Videos and Stories

Let's have a look at how you can add a copyright free music to the videos you share with your followers on Instagram.

### Adding Music to Instagram Videos

The built-in apps for video recording on iPhones and Android phones still don't allow its users to edit the audio track of the videos they capture, but the apps below can be used to add the songs you love to the videos you share on your Instagram account

#### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare's Filmora can be downloaded for free from [Google Play](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [App Store](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6). It is equipped with powerful video editing tools that will enable you to trim videos, change their aspect ratio or alter the video playback speed. These video editing options are accompanied by visually impressive video effects, overlays, and transitions.

Filmora features its own music library of licensed songs that can be easily added to Instagram videos. Once you've added the song you want your video, you can export it directly to Instagram from the app. Filmora is easy to use and it will enable you to save time on adding a soundtrack to a video you created.

#### 2\. [Videoshop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videoshop-video-editor/id615563599?mt=8)

#### 4\. [Flipgram](https://itunes.apple.com/bf/app/flipagram/id512727332?mt=8)

Besides being one of the best apps for video editing for both Android and iPhone devices, Flipgram is also a community of like-minded people where you can find a lot of inspiring content that can motivate you to make remarkable videos.

### Adding Music to Instagram Stories

The ephemeral content is rising in popularity every day, which is the reason why Instagram Stories are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily routines. As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can't really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.

Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.
