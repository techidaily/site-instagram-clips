## Part 1: How to Block Your Followers on Instagram?

Please be informed that when you block someone on Instagram, that person will no longer see your profile, which means they won't be able to contact you or communicate with you. Another thing is that the person that you will block won't be notified about it. There are two ways to do that. One is through your Instagram app, and the second is through the web browser.

**Step 1:** Take your Android or iPhone device and open the Instagram app.

**Step 2:** Log in to your account if you aren't logged in yet. Once you are there, you will see three bars or dots on the right side of your profile. Please tap on that.

**Step 3:** You will see a host of options. From the list, you need to click on the Settings option.

**Step 4:** Now, you need to locate the privacy tab on the settings page and click on it. On the privacy page, you will see the blocked accounts option. Please click on that.

**Step 6:** This is the page where you will see the list of accounts that you have blocked.

## Part 4: How to Unblock Someone on Instagram?

Just like blocking an account is possible, unblocking the same account is possible as well. Yet again, you can unblock someone using your Instagram app on your mobile phone; else, you can use any web browser and do the needful. Readers must note that when you unblock someone, the unlocked user won't know about it, but if they search you, they will be able to locate it. And if you don't keep your account private, they will be able to see all the posts and stories you share. To learn **how to unblock people on Instagram,** follow these simple steps.

### For Instagram app

**Step 1:** Launch Instagram on your Android device or iPhone, and log in to your account if you are not. Your profile will appear first. On your profile, you will see three dots or lines; that's the hamburger icon. Please click on that.

**Step 2:** Once you do, you will see multiple options. From the list, you need to click on the Settings option. You will see the privacy option; please tap on that.

**Step 3:** Under the Privacy tab, you will see some sub-tabs, and one of them will be blocked accounts. You need to hit the blocked accounts option.

**Step 4:** You will see all the accounts that you have blocked. Click on the account that you want to unblock, and click on the unblock option that you see towards the right.

![Instagram Unblock  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unblock-instagram-blocked-accounts.jpg)

**Step 5:** Instagram will ask you to confirm your choice. You need to click on the Unblock option again. That's it; the user has been unblocked successfully.

### Unblocking Instagram User from Web Browsers

**Step 1:** Launch a web browser and visit Instagram, and you will have to log in to your account if you aren't logged in. Use your credentials and log in.

**Step 2:** On the search bar, which will be there on the home page and not on the profile page, you need to find the person you want to unlock.

**Step 3:** Visit their profile, and you will see the unblock option. Click on the unblock option to remove the profile from the blocked list.

![Instagram Unblock from web  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unblock-instagram-users-web.jpg)

**Step 4:** Click on the unblock option, and Instagram will ask you to confirm your choice. Click on the unblock option again, and it's done.

## Part 5: Why Can't I Unblock a Person on Instagram?

If the two-way block has been implemented, then unblocking the same person will become problematic. Let's make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn't know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won't see it because that's how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person's account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.

So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn't appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification "user not found." And this is why you can't unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.
