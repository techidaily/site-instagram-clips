## Why Instagram Post Size Matters?

Knowing Instagram’ supported file formats, sizes, resolutions and frame rates helps maintain the original quality of your videos and images. If you upload large images, Instagram will crop them while publishing small images will make them be enlarged.

Before getting into the nitty-gritty of this article, it is prudent to understand the meaning of the key words concerning Instagram. These include video frame rate, aspect ratio, resolution and Image Size.

## Aspect Ratio, Image Size, Resolution and Video Frame Rate Explained

**Aspect ratio**  refers to the ratio of the width of an image to height. To indicate the aspect ratio of an image we use ratios in the form of 1:1, 2:3 or 5:4 depending on the variants. Instagram aspect ratio of a vertical video is 9:16 while the horizontal ratio is 16:9.

**Image size**  is the height and width of a photo or video in pixels. A standard cover photo for Instagram should be 420px by 654px. A pixel is the smallest area on a display screen.

**Resolution**  is the number of pixels in a video or photo. It is the product of pixels on the width and height of the image. The minimum video resolution on Instagram is 720 pixels.

**Frame rate**  is the rate at which individual images (frames) display on a screen per second and the initial is FPS. For Instagram to support your videos, the minimum frame rate should be 30FPS.

Since you can now interpret video dimensions and photo sizes like a pro, do you know the recommended video dimensions for Instagram for each format?

## Best Instagram Video Dimensions Specifications for a Post

Even though MP4 is the only supported Instagram video format, you can set the videos different orientations and forms. The main orientations are square, landscape (horizontal) and Portrait (vertical).

Since Instagram is not limited to videos, you might be puzzling about the required dimensions for Instagram photos, stories, IGTV, live videos and other supported features like ads. Keep calm, and find all the Instagram dimensions and sizes right in here.

Other than just uploading ordinary videos and sharing photos, you can also **tell a story on Instagram**  using videos and photos in a slideshow format. For business purposes, you can format Instagram stories to **create Instagram Carousel ads**  to use as an advert.

To realize the real importance of Instagram, start using the **video ads feature** , uploading **IGTV videos**  and **streaming live videos** . As you explore all these features, remember to use the specified Max Instagram video dimensions in this article.

### #1 - Instagram Video Dimensions And Sizes

To optimize these Instagram video orientations, here are the dimensional specifications you need to know:

#### Instagram Square Videos

![best video dimensions for instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-videos.jpg)

Even though recording Instagram videos in a landscape form is a lot much easier, the majority of Instagram enthusiasts despise. It is the least used orientation mostly because it occupies a small space and the quality appears distorted.

To recorded landscape videos, set the dimensions in the aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1.91:1\. In a situation where shooting videos in the landscape is necessary, we recommend the 16:9 Instagram size ratio. The maximum dimensions should be set at 1080px by 607px, which is the set cinematic standard.

Moreover, because Instagram stories last for 24 hours, use aspect ratio you are certain will display high-resolution frames.

Instagram story size is less stringed compared to the videos. Instagram allows its users to upload photos and videos for creating a story with an aspect ratio of between 1.91:1 and 9:16\. Below or above these ratios, the story will have borders and thus affect its quality.

The best Instagram story size is be 1080px by 1920px.

To create Instagram carousel ads, you also require a thumbnail image with 1:1 aspect ration and text whose dimensions less than 20% the size of image space.

Due to the many Instagram carousel ads dimension requirements, it is a bit challenging to create perfect ads. Good carousel ads should have a combination of 2-10 images and videos.

But since you’ve to create it anyway, use these Instagram carousel image sizes:

* Carousel Image resolution- 1080px by 1080px
* Maximum single image size- 3MB
* Aspect ratio of 1:1

Your Instagram carousel video sizes should have:

* A maximum length of 60 seconds
* An aspect ratio of 1:1

* Maximum size of 4GB

#### #4 - Instagram IGTV Video Dimensions

IGTV (Instagram TV) is a feature used for sharing videos. Even though Instagram recommends IGTV videos with vertical and horizontal video formats, it displays the vertical format.

Since you require a cover photo for the videos, ensure it has an aspect ratio of 1:1.15 and size of 420px by 654px.

For your IG videos to be accepted, use the following specified IGTV video sizes:

* IGTV video length if uploading from mobile -15 minutes

Instagram live video is broadcast in a vertical format. No much dimensional requirements are specified except the aspect ratio.

The only Instagram Live video requirement is using portrait orientation with an Instagram aspect ratio of 9:16.

#### #6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes

Individuals and businesses are increasingly relying on photographs to promote their profiles and products on Instagram. As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.

Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015\. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).

Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:

Wait!

What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.

#### Instagram Square Photo Size

![instagram story dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg)

As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1\. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:

* Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px
* Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px

This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.

#### Instagram Portrait Photo Size

![instagram story size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg)

For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.

Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350\. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.

#### Instagram Landscape Photo Size

![instagram post size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg)

How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.

Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.

You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9\. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.

If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.

## Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software

The best method to publish high-quality Instagram videos and photos is to edit them before publishing.

Due to the many Instagram carousel ads dimension requirements, it is a bit challenging to create perfect ads. Good carousel ads should have a combination of 2-10 images and videos.

#### #4 - Instagram IGTV Video Dimensions

Since you require a cover photo for the videos, ensure it has an aspect ratio of 1:1.15 and size of 420px by 654px.

For your IG videos to be accepted, use the following specified IGTV video sizes:

#### #6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes

Individuals and businesses are increasingly relying on photographs to promote their profiles and products on Instagram. As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.

Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015\. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).

Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:

Wait!

What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.

#### Instagram Square Photo Size

![instagram story dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg)

As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1\. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:

* Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px
* Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px

This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.

#### Instagram Portrait Photo Size

![instagram story size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg)

For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.

Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350\. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.

#### Instagram Landscape Photo Size

![instagram post size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg)

How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.

Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.

You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9\. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.

If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.

**Image size**  is the height and width of a photo or video in pixels. A standard cover photo for Instagram should be 420px by 654px. A pixel is the smallest area on a display screen.

**Resolution**  is the number of pixels in a video or photo. It is the product of pixels on the width and height of the image. The minimum video resolution on Instagram is 720 pixels.
