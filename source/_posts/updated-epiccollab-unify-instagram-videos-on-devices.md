## Tips for making collage videos

 Here are a couple of tips that are worth giving a thought while making your video collages for Instagram.

**Color:**

 The video collages look better when each frame has colour tones that complement each other.

**Music:**

 The audio of the video should always match with the theme of the video. A well-matched song automatically eliminates any unwanted noise present in the video itself.

**Transitions:**

 Ensure to use smooth transitions when switching videos or photos as abrupt switching may downgrade the charm of such videos.
