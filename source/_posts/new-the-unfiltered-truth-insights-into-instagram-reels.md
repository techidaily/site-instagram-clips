Tired of switching between various apps? Don't you worry anymore; Instagram has got it all! Over the years, Instagram has introduced many new features and has become a one-stop-shop for social media users.

Instagram initially started with the option of only uploading pictures in 2010\. Two years later, in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, and since then, it has been a competitor to many apps. Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.

Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.

## 10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels

Instagramreels are short 15-second multi-clip videos with audio, effects, and other exciting editing tools. This section will let you know all about Instagram Reels, where Facebook launched it first, how huge it has become, how similar it is to TikTok, and much more.

### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands. During the lockdown, people all over the world have taken over TikTok to get rid of their boredom. Instagram Reels is practically the same thing as TikTok. The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.

### #2\. Instagram Reels was first launched in Brazil

Instagram launched the Reels update for a trail run in Brazil in November 2019\. It allowed Reels to be shared on Stories or via DMs. It is called Cenas in Brazil and is part of the Instagram Stories instead of a separate application.

### #3\. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month

Instagram is a worldwide platform that reaches over a billion users every month. This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease.

### #5\. People in the US and India use Instagram Reels most

India and the US have been the most responsive to Instagram Reels. Much of this credit goes to the governments of these countries. In December 2019, Trump tried to get TikTok banned. When the position of TikTok was up for grabs, Facebook immediately acted upon it. Similarly, as TikTok has been banned in India, Instagram users are thrilled to get a similar platform where they can make multi-clip videos.

### #7\. The top 5 creators on Instagram Reels are Netflix, Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, Asos, NBA Basketball

Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, and Asos have also made Reels featuring their products, maximizing customer engagement. Finally, as mentioned above, NBA franchises are also making their contribution to the success of the Reels.

### #8\. Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels

Along with Instagram Reels, Facebook also introduced the Shop tab. Here you can shop on Instagram, support small businesses, and be inspired by your favorite creators. Other than that, Reel creators can tag a product, and people can then click on it to either find more info or buy it.

### #9\. Instagram Reels may soon appear on Facebook

Facebook has been considering running tests in India to give users the option to share their Reels on Facebook as well as Instagram. This will significantly increase the reach of users, content creators, and businesses. It has excellent monetization potential and will surely be successful.

### #10\. Can Instagram Reels replace TikTok?

Instagram Reels has been successful, but the big question is that can it replace TikTok? Well, since its launch, it has caught the attention of many TikTok users, but it still has a long way to go before it can completely replace TikTok. Currently, TikTok is relatively better as it provides more options and space to grow as compared to the Reels. However, we are sure that Facebook will not give up so quickly and continue to update Instagram.
