## Guide to how to hide hashtags on Instagram step by step

Hiding hashtags is really quite easy and shouldn't add much more time to your post creation at all. Here's a step by step tutorial on how to hide hashtags on Instagram:

* **Download a text editor for your phone or tablet:** There are loads out there, from the Notes app which comes built into iOS to popular downloads like Monospace, JotterPad and Evernote
* **Make five dots:** Sounds bonkers, we know, but just go with it for now. Type a dot, then press return. Repeat this five times. You should now have a lovely vertical line of dots on the left-hand side of your note.
* **List your hashtags:** On the next line down, start your list of hashtags. Because these will be hidden, you can add as many as you like, up to 30 in total as per Instagram's allocation.
* **Copy it all:** Copy everything on the note, including the dots and line breaks. How you do this will depend on your device, but a long press often brings up the copy option on most phones.
* **Open Instagram and create your post:** Load up your photo or video and write your caption for it. Do not include any hashtags at all at this stage. Post your post: Share your post with your followers.
