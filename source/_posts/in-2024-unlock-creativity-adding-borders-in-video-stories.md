**Step 3:** If the imported media file doesn't fit the aspect ratio on the timeline, right-click the clip and select the **Crop to Fit** option from the display to fit the video onto the timeline.

**Step 4**: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the **Effect** tab present on the horizontal menu.

**Step 5**: In the **Effects** tab, look for the **Utility** option to open an array of effects, such as **Mosaic,** **Shape Mask, Auto Enhance, Image Mask**, and **Borders**.

**Step 7:** After locating the **Border** effect, tap and hold the effect to drag and drop onto the timeline, as shown in the picture below. You will now see your video with the **Border** effect applied to it.

## Part 3: How to Add Border to Video for Instagram Online?

In this part of the guide, we will look at three methods and guide you on how to add border to video for Instagram online using Kapwing, Canva

### 1\. Kapwing

It's a free online application for editing photos, movies, and GIFs. It does not need registration, so you may begin editing instantly and securely. You have a 250 MB upload limit and may export videos up to 7 minutes in length. Here's your step-by-step guide to **add border to video for Instagram** using Kapwing:

**Step 1**: Select the Start editing on Kapwing's website. It will lead you to the video file upload screen, where you may drag and drop the file or **Click to upload**.

![add video image kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-video-image-kapwing.jpg)

**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.
