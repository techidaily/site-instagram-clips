**Step 4**: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the **Effect** tab present on the horizontal menu.

**Step 5**: In the **Effects** tab, look for the **Utility** option to open an array of effects, such as **Mosaic,** **Shape Mask, Auto Enhance, Image Mask**, and **Borders**.

**Step 7:** After locating the **Border** effect, tap and hold the effect to drag and drop onto the timeline, as shown in the picture below. You will now see your video with the **Border** effect applied to it.

**Step 1**: Select the Start editing on Kapwing's website. It will lead you to the video file upload screen, where you may drag and drop the file or **Click to upload**.

**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.
