 If the troubleshooter failed to detect your issue, please check out the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of in-game sound issue is the**broken or outdated audio driver** . So you should update your audio driver to see it it fixes your problem.

 You can update your audio driver manually, by going to the manufacture website of your sound card and search for the latest driver for your exact module. But this takes quite a while. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

And it’s quite easy to update too:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/windows-update-run-box.jpg)

3. Once you’ve installed the updates, restart your computer for it to take full effect.

 To install all the system updates, you might need to**repeat these steps** **several times** until it prompts that “you’re up to date” when you click Check for updates.

You can now open Modern Warfare and check the in-game audio.

 If this method doesn’t work for you, simply move on to the next one below.

### Fix 6: Close conflicting software

 Some players reported that they managed to get the sound back by closing programs that have audio output. You can try this method by closing apps such as**Discord** ,**Skype** and**Chrome** , as they might affect the in-game audio.

### Fix 7: Change your audio channel

 In some cases, output devices with some high-end features (e.g. 5.1 surround sound) might not work so well on your system, so you’ll need to change your audio channel for the audio output. This solution also apply to the case where players have only cinematic music and no sound effects.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On the lower-right corner of your desktop, right-click the**volume icon** and select**Sound** .
