Instagram, well-known for being a visually appealing social platform, is now going to sound better too. Yes, you heard me right. Now you can add an Instagram music sticker to insert a soundtrack to your story.

Finally, you can make your stories to the beat of your favorite song. If you were not able to express your mood through a no-audio video, this is your chance to add-in a song that best relates to your emotions

Shoot beautiful scenery and add the Instagram music sticker to complement it with the perfect song. A treat for both your eyes and ears!

## Part 1: How to Get the Music Sticker on Instagram

Now, what good is the music sticker if you don't get to use it? Well, I am here to make sure that you do. However, let me warn you that if you still don't see the sticker, it might not be available in your region

There is no rocket science to getting your hands on the music sticker. It's sometimes the glitches blocking our way.

Here are various ways to get the music sticker. All are tried and tested.

1.The first and foremost step is to capture a photo/video or choose a pre-existing one from your gallery.

2.Tap the Stickers button and choose the Music sticker.

![Find Instagram Music Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-instagram-music-sticker.jpg)

Now, if you don't see the music sticker this way, try these:

* Borrow- Search a friend's story featuring music. Tap on the music sticker, and a pop-up will display. Click on Try Music in Your Story. Discard it then and return to your sticker library to check if it reappears
* Update- You might be using the older version. Go to the app store and update

![Update Instagram App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/update-instagram-app.jpg)

* Re-Login –Go to Settings and log out and then log in again (P.S do this only if you remember your password)
* Music App- Use Spotify or Soundcloud to upload songs to your story directly. Open the song you wish to share. Click on the three dots and select Share to Instagram story

![Add Music Sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-sticker.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Add Music to Instagram Story with Music Sticker

Did I tell you that you can customize the music sticker? Oh, my bad. As we know that Instagram has a creative and diverse audience, the music sticker allows customizations. Now, what exactly does that mean?

* You can change the size and location of the music sticker on your story.
* You can choose to add lyrics to the song or choose to display it as a music player.
* The font of the lyric can also be changed
* You can even change the color of the music player or the lyrics
* Choose the length of the song (max 15seconds)

Now that you have gained access to the music sticker let's talk about how it can be used to add your favorite music.

1.Shoot a photo/video as an Instagram story or choose an older one from your gallery

2.Click on Stickers on the top and choose 'Music' from the stickers

3.Tap on Music, and you will be presented with a list of songs. Categorized as popular, genre, and moods so that you can quickly swipe through the desired list to choose a perfect piece. Or you can even search for a specific song in the search bar above

4.Preview the song by playing it in the app

5.Once you find that perfect song to go with your video, click Add. Voila!
