If you've found an Instagram video that you love, chances are you don't want it to just disappear into the endless flood of posts on your feed. After all, you might want to see it again. But, if you've ever tried to download Instagram videos on PC or Mac, you'll know it's not all that easy. You can't do it straight from the app or website, so how can you make it work?

Here, we'll highlight a few tried and tested methods of how to download Instagram videos so that you can save all your favorites for evermore.

## How to download Instagram videos on PC and Mac

There are a few [different solutions to help you download Instagram videos on PC or Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), some of which require at least a degree in coding to get your head around. We've selected three of the easiest and most accessible methods to share with you, and we promise you don't need to speak HTML to use them!

* [Method 1: Source code](#part1)
* [Method 2: Online solutions](#part2)
* [Method 3: Add-ons](#part3)

### Method 1: Source code

Did you know that there's a way to inspect the source code of the Instagram video page? 'What the heck is source code?', we hear you cry. Well, it doesn't really matter what it is, and you don't need to understand it at all, because all you're looking for here is a little link that will let you download the video directly to your computer. Here's how you do it:

![Source code](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/how-to-download-instagram-videos-on-pc-and-mac-01.jpg)

* Open the video you'd like to download on Instagram
* Right-click (or on a Mac, ⌘+click) and choose 'inspect element' or 'view page source', depending on the specific browser that you're using.
* Press Ctrl+F (or ⌘+F on a Mac) to open the 'find' menu
* Type in .mp4 into the box, and the search will return a section of code
* Look for a hyperlinked bit of code that is next to 'src=' and ends with .mp4
* Select this, and copy it using Ctrl+C (or ⌘+C), and then paste it into your browser using Ctrl+P (or ⌘+P)
* The video will play in the window. Simply right-click (or ⌘+click) and select 'save video as' to download the video to your PC's hard drive

This might sound all a bit cumbersome, but once you've had a couple of goes you'll find it's not as hard as it looks. If you're not used to keyboard shortcuts you might have a bit of a learning curve to traverse, but overall, it's a tried and tested method to download Instagram videos on PC and Mac that is popular with many users.

### Method 2: Online solutions

### Method 3: Add-ons

The one last method we wanted to share with you is to use a browser extension to facilitate your download.
