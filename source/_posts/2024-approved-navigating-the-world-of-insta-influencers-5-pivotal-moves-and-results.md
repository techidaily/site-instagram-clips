### 5\. Call to action

 A call to action within the visual content or caption can make things easier and clear for your viewers. While creating an Instagram campaign, it is essential to have a call to action within your video content which engages your audiences deeply with your brand.

The Instagram page and its specific segments are visited more than 11 times per day and it is definitely a sticky platform. So, you need to give your audience some very strong reason to leave the platform and move to your page as you want.
