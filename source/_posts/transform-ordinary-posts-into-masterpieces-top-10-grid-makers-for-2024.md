You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).

To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts.

## Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts

When it comes to the overall implementation of grid ideas on Instagram, the sky is the limit. To get better results for your Instagram’s grid layout, you can consider following these expert suggestions:

#### Consistency is the key

A lot of people simply think that coming up with 9 posts for Instagram would make your profile look visually appealing. It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.

#### Align it with your brand’s vision

Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.

#### Focus on color combinations

Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough. You need to maintain the overall visual appeal of your profile by sticking to certain color combinations. You can either maintain a single-colored layout or mix two or three colors to come up with a consistent look.

![fashion puzzle template ig](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fashion-puzzle-template-ig.jpg)

#### Preview before posting

Most importantly, try to get a preview of your Instagram grid before posting it on your profile. There are all kinds of preview apps (mobile and online) that you can try to do the same. In this way, you can easily notice if there is an alignment issue with your photos before posting them on your profile.

### Conclusion

Well, now it’s your turn to come up with some stunning grid layouts for your Instagram profile! I’m sure that you can easily select the best Instagram grid maker from this handpicked list. You can use either of these Instagram grid makers (online or mobile tools) to meet your requirements. Just make sure you follow a consistent appeal and have a planned storytelling approach that would help you attain an impressive presence on Instagram for sure.

## Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts

When it comes to the overall implementation of grid ideas on Instagram, the sky is the limit. To get better results for your Instagram’s grid layout, you can consider following these expert suggestions:

#### Consistency is the key

A lot of people simply think that coming up with 9 posts for Instagram would make your profile look visually appealing. It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.

#### Align it with your brand’s vision

Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.

#### Focus on color combinations

Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough. You need to maintain the overall visual appeal of your profile by sticking to certain color combinations. You can either maintain a single-colored layout or mix two or three colors to come up with a consistent look.

![fashion puzzle template ig](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fashion-puzzle-template-ig.jpg)

#### Preview before posting

Most importantly, try to get a preview of your Instagram grid before posting it on your profile. There are all kinds of preview apps (mobile and online) that you can try to do the same. In this way, you can easily notice if there is an alignment issue with your photos before posting them on your profile.

### Conclusion

Well, now it’s your turn to come up with some stunning grid layouts for your Instagram profile! I’m sure that you can easily select the best Instagram grid maker from this handpicked list. You can use either of these Instagram grid makers (online or mobile tools) to meet your requirements. Just make sure you follow a consistent appeal and have a planned storytelling approach that would help you attain an impressive presence on Instagram for sure.
