## Instagram Craftsmanship: Incorporating Descriptive Texts

Are you fond of using Instagram? Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms that many people use to connect with each other. You can share photos, videos, and stories with your followers to provide a highlight of your daily activities and experiences.

Moreover, you can use filters provided on Instagram to make your photos or videos more engaging. You can also add captions to them to easily reach your target audience. In this article, you can learn **how to add captions to Instagram videos** efficiently. We will highlight three different ways that can assist you in adding captions to your Instagram videos.
