## Part 1: What is an Instagram Filter?

The Instagram filter is a valuable tool that enables you to alter your picture with a single click by making relevant adjustments to the photo on Instagram. The feature for the Instagram filter was released in 2011 with a few basic choices for filtering your image. It provides the user with multiple ways to edit a picture with more excellent quality, an extra border, and even some significant tilt-shift effects. Because of the easy and friendly layout of Instagram, it is much easier for the user to apply filters. And, it is better to keep your application updated as Instagram is constantly releasing new layouts for the convenience of its users.

This feature, although user-friendly, might be confusing for some. That is why we will show you how to enhance your posts and stories in a few simple steps.

## Part 2: How to Add Filters to a Photo and Video on Instagram Story?

With the easy layout provided by Instagram, it is incredibly easy to edit your pictures.

## Part 5: How to Organize the Instagram Filters for Post/Reels/Feed?

Instagram is a great application that offers a wide range of filters to its users. Even though it's a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.

The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post/Reels/Feed.

**Step 1: Tap on Manage Option**

The initial step is to select or capture a photo/video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the **Manage** option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.

**Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters**

For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.

**Note:** Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the **Drag to hide** option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.
