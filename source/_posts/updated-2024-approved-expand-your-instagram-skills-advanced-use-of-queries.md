## Part 1: Instagram Story Question Sticker: What Is It and How Does It Work?

Instagram released a new fun and exciting feature for customers to engage in in July 2018\. The sticker "Questions" can be applied to your Stories to enable your friends to make submissions. The Instagram Story question sticker is a simple method to engage with your followers by enabling them to express their opinions and preferences with you quickly.

It's accessible to everyone on the official Instagram iOS and Android applications, and it's not only for verified profiles or those with a lot of followers.

#### 1\. The Popularity

Instagram's popularity stems in part from the fact that this is such a communicative tool. You may engage with individuals and companies in various ways, including responding to their postings and sharing their Stories—the best being the Instagram question stickers.

#### 2\. Follower Engagement

One of the best aspects of this function is that it allows your followers to communicate with you privately in a far less intrusive way than direct messages. If you opt to respond to DMs personally, it'll be full of hassle.

#### 3\. Follower Privacy

The answers of your followers are not publicly visible as only you can view them. Their picture and identity will not display when you post one of their replies in a Story.

You may also use other stickers, including the survey sticker or the emoji sliders, to ask any questions.

## Part 5: Tips for Using Instagram Question Stickers

Embedding questions to your Stories is simple, but it may benefit your content strategy and brand image with some tips. Here are some tips to know when using Question Story Stickers:

### 1\. Keep it Simple

When Instagram introduces a new feature, it might seem like a massive wave is breaking over your Stories as businesses rush to be the ones to use it.

Don't make your audience suffer from New Feature Syndrome! Questions (and all other additional features) should be used cautiously and wisely. It's essential to use it correctly than to use it frequently.

### 2\. Make it Count

You put a lot of thought into the content strategy driving your Stories and posts, ensuring consistency with your marketing strategy and aesthetics. As a result, you adopt the same strategy as before.

If you're looking to obtain product feedback, establish a connection with customers, or create momentum for a promotion, you must have a purpose in mind when responding to questions. Otherwise, your work and the reactions of your audience would be wasted.

### 3\. Don't Forget to Respond

This may sound self-evident, but you ought to be prepared to respond when you want your audience to ask questions. Don't let your fans down; they are going to expect it from you.

Take some time off of your busy schedule to observe and respond to all of the queries that have been received. To estimate how many to expect, check your Instagram data, such as your average rate of Story responses.

You should be prepared to answer challenging inquiries or even unfavorable criticism based on your organization and community. Inquiries might assist you in restoring confidence and exhibit openness if you've had a social media mishap.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Can You Answer a Question After 24 Hours?

For the next 24 hours, your followers will be able to view your Story and reply to it. Afterward, when, as long as the Instagram Story is archived, you'll be allowed to see and react to inquiries.
