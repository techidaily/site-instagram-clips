## Part 1: How to Record Video in Reverse on Instagram?

When you play a video backwards, you will generate some unique effects with your video. Examples include making people walk backward, getting them to leap forward instead of forward, and dancing in reverse.

While many would also say that you can challenge the principles of science, whether it's releasing a microphone and seeing it fly up into your palm or filming a fountain in action and showing a replay of the water rising right up to the top of your display.

You can even make pets run backward and rainfall up instead of down. Many of the significant consumer video editing applications (such as Snapchat) have begun to follow the trend, and they are all doing it effortlessly!

_Here's how you can record video in reverse on Instagram:_

**Step 1:** If you want to create a video that plays in reverse mode, start by opening the **Instagram Stories** camera.

**Step 2:** Swipe through the available choices at the bottom of the display, such as **_Hands-Free, Boomerang, Live_**, etc., until you reach the **Rewind recording** mode, which looks like this as shown in the picture below.

**Step 3:** Click the **Record button** at the bottom of the display to create videos.

And there you have it – you've just recorded a video in reverse mode on Instagram!

## Part 2: How to Reverse Video on Instagram Reels and Story on Mobile?

To reverse a recorded video and upload to Instagram later, you can also try some mobile video editing software on Android and iPhone. CapCut is one of the best reverse video program that we suggest the most for you to use out of all the ones available on the market.

In addition to being completely free and without a watermark, the instructions on how to reverse in CapCut are also straightforward to follow. With a single click, you can instantly create a reverse video on your Android or iOS device without the need to first configure any settings.

_Here are the steps that you should be familiar with and practice if necessary:_

**Step 1:** Open the **CapCut** application on your smartphone and click on the **Create a New Project** option, to begin with.

**Step 2:** Now, select the video of your choice from the phone **Gallery** and press the **Add** button to import it to the CapCut app.

![add video to capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-video-to-capcut.jpg)

_Note: If you want to download your previous Story or Reels videos, you can try some_ [_video downloaders for Instagram_](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) _to get your videos._

**Step 3**: After the file has been imported, tap on the **Effects** option as shown at the bottom of your display. From the array of options available in the Effects menu, swipe to your right-hand side until you reach the **Reverse** option, as shown in the picture below. Now, click on it.

**Step 4:** The moment you click on the Reverse option, the video will automatically start reversing. It may take a while to reverse the video if the **_size of the video_** is too large. In our case, this Wondershare Filmora video was only 24 seconds which didn't take longer than 40 seconds to reverse.

**Step 5**: Once the video is reversed, you can begin **Exporting** the file by clicking the **Arrow-like** option in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. And now, you can **Share/Upload** the reversed video to Instagram.
