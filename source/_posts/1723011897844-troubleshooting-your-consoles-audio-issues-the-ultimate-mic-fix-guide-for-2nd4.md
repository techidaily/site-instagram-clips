### Fix 1: End unnecessary programs

 The game freezing issue commonly occurs when you’re running multiple applications simultaneously on your PC. It’s probable that your computer doesn’t have enough power or memory to support all of the programs you’re opening. So, you should end unnecessary programs while gaming.

Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**2)** Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what processes are consuming your resources most.

**3)**  Right-click the resource-consuming process and select **End task** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Relaunch your game to see if it runs properly now. If the issue continues to occur, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The _PoE_ freezing issue may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-02-53.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-02-59.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

4) Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your issue continues to occur, move on and try the next fix.

### Fix 3: Run your game as an administrator

 Running your game as an administrator can grant it full access to game files and folder on your PC.

**1)** Make sure Steam isn’t running your PC.

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-10-03.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **Compatibility tab** and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** .

**4)** Click **Apply** , then **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-10-18.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

 Game freezing issues happen when a certain game file is damaged or missing. Try verifying the integrity of your game files to see if that’s the problem for you.

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)**  Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-15-04.jpg)

**3)**  Right-click **Path of Exile** and select **Properties.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-15-08-1.jpg)

**4)**  Click the **LOCAL FILES**  tab, and then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 5: Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory combines your RAM with temporary space on your hard disk. If you’re running out of RAM and the default size of your virtual memory isn’t large enough for your needs, you’ll need to increase it manually.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then, click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-29-35.jpg)

**2)** Click **Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-31-38.jpg)

**4)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

**6)** Select your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-31-52.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-33-50.jpg)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-32-10.jpg)

**9)** Restart your computer and your game.

If your issue persists, then ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 6: Check for Windows updates

 Windows releases regular updates to resolve bugs. It’s possible that a recent update has stopped _Path of Exile_ from running correctly, and that a new update is required to fix it.

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-47-57.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-48-06.jpg)

 Restart your computer and your game. If your issue still exists, try the fix, below.

### Fix 7: Reinstall Steam

 If none of the fixes above worked for you, reinstalling Steam is very likely the solution to your issue. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and type **control** . Then, click **Control Panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-51-23.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**2)** Under **View by** , select **Category.**  Then, select **Uninstall a program** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-51-32.jpg)

**3)** Right-click **Steam** , and then click **Uninstall** . Then, wait for the process to be complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_11-51-38.jpg)

 **4)[Download](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)**  and install Steam. Then, reinstall your game on Steam.

### Fix 8: Clean the interior of your PC

 Your computer is prone to overheating if it’s clogged with dust. The dust can cause ventilation problems, trapping heat and preventing your PC from cooling itself properly. As a result, your game might not be able to run smoothly.

 So you should clean your computer’s case to prevent dust build-up. (If you aren’t comfortable opening your computer case, you may want to hire a technician to do it for you.)

 After cleaning up your PC case, carefully remove the RAM module from the slot and look for corrosion. If everything is fine, reinstall the module and make sure that it’s seated securely in the socket.

Relaunch the game to see if this helped.

 Hopefully, you’re able to play the game now! Feel free to leave a comment below if you have any questions or suggestions.
