### 1\. Memes are Very Easy to Understand

 Memes are meant to be something that we use in order to easily communicate ideas with other people. Memes capture the essence of a thought in a creative way that everyone understands. They’re visual, they’re short, they catch our attention and they help people to grasp your thoughts in a quick, concise way.

### 2\. We Like Sharing Memes

 Think about it – if you see a meme that you find amusing or that fits you or someone you know really well, then you will share it to your social media page or send it to your friend. Sharing memes is a lot of fun, and so it’s become something that is really popular for many of us to do.
