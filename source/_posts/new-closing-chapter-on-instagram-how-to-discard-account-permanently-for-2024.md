Most people donâ€™t realize time flying while using Instagram and it can become very addictive.

This problem is sorted out by deactivating or deleting the Instagram account. The difference between deleting an Instagram account and deactivating an Instagram account is that while deleting is permanent, deactivating is temporary.

Letâ€™s have a look at how both these actions can be performed in case you feel like Instagram is impacting your life more than itâ€™s needed.
