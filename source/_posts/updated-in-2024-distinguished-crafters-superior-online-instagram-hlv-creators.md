 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

We are living in an age of social media, and the intensive sharing of photos, which millions can see, is commonplace on a daily level. No doubt, one of the most popular social platforms around the world is Instagram, with the exciting option - IG Story. With this feature, posted photos and short videos disappear after 24 hours. The only thing you can do to save them on your account is to add them to Highlights. Since Instagram doesn't support making cover itself on the app, you need a dedicated third-party tool to do it. With Instagram highlight cover maker online, you can create a specific cover for the Highlights icon, and make your content more attractive for your followers.

In the next paragraphs, we introduce you to 10 of the best online Instagram Highlight cover maker apps.

## Best online Instagram Highlight Cover Makers

### 1\. [Canva: Graphic Design, Video, Invite & Logo Maker](https://www.canva.com/)

Everything you need to create a Highlight icon – the specific Instagram stories section, is on this platform. It is designed for a graphic designer, but it is very friendly for anyone, no matter of the level of skills. The app includes a lot of pre-designed samples, free stock photos, illustrations, music, frames, and more, which you can use to create the cover. Of course, you can produce a unique cover starting the creative process from a blank canvas, or upload your own photo from a PC or mobile phone.

A rich content library is at your disposal, with many backgrounds, shapes, colors, stickers, GIFs, and fonts. The text of the Highlights cover is important, so you can choose more than 500 fonts to express a range of emotions and attitudes. For the simplest cover, literally, you need to do just a few clicks. When you open the Canvas maker, add a circle on the page, select some of the offered graphics and choose the colors.
