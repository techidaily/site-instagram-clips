## Part 2: How to Search New Filters on Instagram from Creators' Profile

Even though official Instagram allows the creators to make their filters and then upload them on Instagram, you can use Instagram's filters and the filters created by others.

This way, you can also get to know about the creators who make good Instagram filters. You can follow the following steps to understand how to find Instagram filters through the creator's profile:

### Step 1: Find Creator's Profile
