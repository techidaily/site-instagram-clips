## Part 2: How to Add Music to Instagram without Music Stickers?

Instagram music works in most cases, but it may be useless if you do not find music of your choice. Sometimes, you want to add a specific song to go with the video's vibe or a photo. In that case, you can upload music using other methods as well. Here, we will share four ways to put music to Instagram stories without stickers.

### **Method 1: Add music** **to Instagram through Spotify Music**

Thanks to the update from both partners, i.e., Instagram and Spotify, which teamed up back in 2018, now you don't have to share a screenshot of a song from Spotify to let the audience know what you're listening to!

Spotify has millions of songs to listen to and add to your library. You can post all the songs you listen to on your stories to make your content look more appealing. Let's have a look at a few steps that you can use to post music from Spotify on Instagram:

**Step 1: Log in to Spotify** and **select a song:**

**Log in to** your existing account or create a new one. Select one of the songs from your list or search for the one you like. You will see **three dots** on the right corner; click on them.

**Step 2: Select Instagram stories**

When you click on the three dots, you will be presented with a few options; click **on share**. After clicking on share, you will see a few apps options; click **on Instagram stories**.

S**tep 2: Select Instagram stories**
