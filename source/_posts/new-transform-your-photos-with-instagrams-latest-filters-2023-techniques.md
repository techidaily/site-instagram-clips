## Part 1: What is an Instagram Filter?

The Instagram filter is a valuable tool that enables you to alter your picture with a single click by making relevant adjustments to the photo on Instagram. The feature for the Instagram filter was released in 2011 with a few basic choices for filtering your image. It provides the user with multiple ways to edit a picture with more excellent quality, an extra border, and even some significant tilt-shift effects. Because of the easy and friendly layout of Instagram, it is much easier for the user to apply filters. And, it is better to keep your application updated as Instagram is constantly releasing new layouts for the convenience of its users.

This feature, although user-friendly, might be confusing for some. That is why we will show you how to enhance your posts and stories in a few simple steps.

## Part 2: How to Add Filters to a Photo and Video on Instagram Story?

With the easy layout provided by Instagram, it is incredibly easy to edit your pictures. Specifically, talking about adding filters to a photo or video on the Instagram story is probably the easiest thing to do on Instagram, and it does not even take much time. Adding filters to your photo or video can take a maximum of five minutes to do so.

Following are the steps to add filters to a photo and video on Instagram Story, so you no longer have to worry about **how to use filters on Insta**. Make sure you follow every step so you can successfully get the job done.

**Step 1: Select or Capture a Photo/Video**

The initial step is to open your camera on Instagram and swipe up to select an existing picture/video or capture a photo/video to apply a filter.

**Note:** Another way to add an existing picture is to tap on the bottom left corner, where you can see the photo gallery icon. Next, tap on the image you want to apply the filter on.

## Part 4: How to Add Filters on Instagram Reels?

Instagram Reels are very similar to TikTok videos, with the iconic feature of uploading entertaining short fifteen-second videos as Instagram Reels. Instagram reels are one of the most prominent features of the new updated version of the Instagram Application.

This method is quite similar to that of applying filters to Instagram stories. For your ease, we have listed a step-by-step guide below to add filters on Instagram reels.

**Step 1: Go to Create Mode**

Tap on the camera icon on the top left corner of the screen. And then, tap on the Reels option to go to Instagram reels create mode.

**Note:** Another way to create an Instagram Reel is to go to the reels explore page and tap on the camera icon present at the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 2: Tap on the Smiley Face Icon**

Next, tap on the **Smiley Face Icon** to add filters. Choose from the variety of available filters. Then tap on the chosen filter to apply it to your Instagram reel.

**Step 3: Start Recording**

Once you are done selecting the desired filter for your Instagram reel, start recording. After the recording is done, you will notice the filter added to the whole Instagram reel you just shot.

## Part 5: How to Organize the Instagram Filters for Post/Reels/Feed?

Instagram is a great application that offers a wide range of filters to its users. Even though it's a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.

The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post/Reels/Feed.

**Step 1: Tap on Manage Option**

The initial step is to select or capture a photo/video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the **Manage** option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters**

For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.

**Note:** Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the **Drag to hide** option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.
